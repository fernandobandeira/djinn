# Ideation - Creative Idea Generator

Generate ideas systematically using structured creativity techniques. Break out of habitual thinking to find unexpected solutions.

## Quick Start

1. Define what you're generating ideas for
2. Select technique based on what kind of thinking you need
3. Generate many ideas before evaluating any

## Technique Selection

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Systematically modify existing concept | SCAMPER | Structured prompts cover all modification angles |
| Balance wild ideas with practicality | Walt Disney Method | Separates dreaming, planning, and critiquing |
| Stuck and need fresh perspective | Reverse Brainstorming | Solve the opposite problem to unlock thinking |

**Default**: Use SCAMPER for improving existing things, Walt Disney for new concepts.

## Techniques

### SCAMPER
Systematic prompts to modify and improve ideas: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to Another Use, Eliminate, Rearrange.

### Walt Disney Method
Three distinct phases: Dreamer (wild ideas), Realist (practical planning), Critic (find problems). Named after Disney's creative process.

### Reverse Brainstorming
Generate ideas by solving the opposite problem. "How do we make this worse?" leads to "How do we make it better."

## Core Principles

1. **Quantity first** - Generate many ideas before judging any
2. **Wild is welcome** - Impractical ideas often spark practical ones
3. **Build on ideas** - "Yes, and..." beats "No, but..."
4. **Defer judgment** - Evaluation kills creativity if done too early
5. **Capture everything** - Write it down, even the "bad" ideas

## When Ideation Works Best

- Need fresh approaches to stale problems
- Current solutions aren't good enough
- Brainstorming sessions produce same old ideas
- Want to explore possibility space
- Team is stuck in conventional thinking

## The Ideation Mindset

Treat ideation as exploration, not evaluation. The goal isn't to find THE answer - it's to expand what's possible before narrowing down.

Bad ideas are valuable:
- They might spark good ideas
- They define the boundary of possibility
- They give permission for risk-taking
- They're often not as bad as they first seem
