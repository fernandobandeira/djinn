# SCAMPER

Systematic prompts to generate ideas by modifying existing concepts. Each letter represents a different way to transform something. Invented by Bob Eberle, based on Alex Osborn's brainstorming techniques.

## When to Use

- Improving an existing product, process, or idea
- Need structured approach to creativity
- Brainstorming feels random or unfocused
- Want comprehensive coverage of modification options
- Time: 20-40 minutes

## The SCAMPER Framework

### S - Substitute
What can be replaced with something else?

**Questions**:
- What components can be substituted?
- What materials can be replaced?
- Who else could do this?
- What other process could we use?
- What if we changed the setting/location?
- What other approach could we take?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Substitute staff with automation for ordering
- Substitute plastic cups with edible cups
- Substitute fixed location with mobile cart
- Substitute coffee with other energy drinks

### C - Combine
What can be merged together?

**Questions**:
- What can we combine with something else?
- What ideas can be merged?
- What functions can be combined?
- What purposes can we blend?
- Can we combine resources with another team/org?
- What could we bundle together?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Combine with coworking space
- Combine with bookstore
- Combine coffee with vitamins/supplements
- Combine ordering with loyalty program
- Combine with laundromat (do tasks while waiting)

### A - Adapt
What can be adjusted for a different context?

**Questions**:
- What else is this like?
- What could we copy from another industry?
- How has this problem been solved elsewhere?
- What ideas from other fields can we borrow?
- How can we adjust for different users?
- What if we adapted this for a different market?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Adapt subscription model from SaaS
- Adapt drive-through from fast food
- Adapt appointment booking from salons
- Adapt dark kitchen model from restaurants
- Adapt "genius bar" concept from Apple

### M - Modify/Magnify/Minimize
What can be changed in scale, form, or attributes?

**Questions**:
- What can we make bigger/smaller?
- What can we make stronger/lighter?
- What can we exaggerate?
- What attributes can we enhance?
- What can we minimize or reduce?
- What if we changed the shape/color/texture?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Magnify: Huge cups, very strong coffee, massive loyalty rewards
- Minimize: Tiny shop (10 sq ft), minimum menu (3 items only)
- Modify: Change hours (24/7 vs. 4am-noon only)
- Modify: Different seating (standing only, hammocks, private pods)

### P - Put to Another Use
What other purposes could this serve?

**Questions**:
- What else could this be used for?
- Who else could use this?
- Could this solve a different problem?
- What could we repurpose?
- What unexpected uses exist?
- In what other contexts would this work?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Use as event venue after hours
- Use as package pickup location
- Use as remote work office space
- Use as meeting room rental
- Use as community bulletin board
- Use as art gallery

### E - Eliminate
What can be removed?

**Questions**:
- What can we get rid of?
- What's unnecessary?
- What would happen if we removed this component?
- What can be simplified?
- What's only there because of tradition?
- What if we removed the rules?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Eliminate physical store (delivery only)
- Eliminate menu (barista's choice)
- Eliminate payment at counter (subscription/app only)
- Eliminate cups (bring your own)
- Eliminate waiting (guaranteed <60 seconds)
- Eliminate baristas (fully automated)

### R - Rearrange/Reverse
What can be reordered or inverted?

**Questions**:
- What if we reversed the process?
- What if we changed the sequence?
- What if we swapped roles?
- What if we did this backward?
- What if we rearranged the layout?
- What if we reversed the flow?

**Example** (Coffee shop):
- Reverse: Customer makes their own coffee
- Reverse: Pay at end instead of beginning
- Rearrange: Coffee delivered, then you pick where to drink
- Reverse: Evening focus instead of morning
- Rearrange: Kitchen in front, seating in back
- Reverse: Customers set prices (pay what you want)

## Running a SCAMPER Session

### Solo Process (20-30 min)

1. **Write down what you're improving** (1 min)
2. **Set timer for 3 min per letter** (21 min)
3. **For each letter**: Write 3-5 ideas, no filtering
4. **Review all ideas** (5 min): Star the promising ones
5. **Develop top 3** (5 min): Flesh out the best ideas

### Group Process (40-60 min)

1. **Define focus** (5 min)
2. **Individual SCAMPER** (15 min): Everyone does solo
3. **Share round** (15 min): 2-3 ideas per letter, round-robin
4. **Build on favorites** (10 min): "Yes, and..." promising ideas
5. **Vote and prioritize** (5 min)

## Tips for Better SCAMPER

### Don't skip letters
Even if a letter seems irrelevant, force yourself to generate ideas. The "irrelevant" prompts often produce the most novel ideas.

### Go for volume
3 ideas minimum per letter. Bad ideas count - they might spark good ones.

### Think extreme
When stuck, go to extremes. "What if we eliminated EVERYTHING?" often unlocks thinking.

### Borrow widely
For "Adapt," look at completely unrelated industries. How would a hospital/airline/game company solve this?

### Combine combinations
After SCAMPER, look for ideas from different letters that could combine.

## Common Mistakes

- **Evaluating while generating**: Save judgment for after
- **Staying safe**: The weird ideas are the point
- **Skipping letters**: Every letter has value
- **One idea per letter**: Push for multiple options
- **Ignoring "bad" ideas**: They inform the space of possibilities
