# Reverse Brainstorming

Generate ideas by solving the opposite problem. Instead of "how do we improve X," ask "how do we make X worse?" Then reverse those ideas into solutions.

## When to Use

- Stuck on a problem, can't generate ideas
- Need fresh perspective on familiar challenge
- Want to identify hidden problems
- Looking for unconventional solutions
- Time: 15-30 minutes

## Why It Works

**Our brains find it easier to**:
- Criticize than create
- See problems than solutions
- Imagine failure than success

Reverse brainstorming harnesses this tendency. It's psychologically easier to think of ways to cause problems than to solve them.

**Bonus benefit**: The "make it worse" ideas often reveal actual problems you hadn't noticed.

## The Process

### Step 1: Define the Goal (2 min)

State what you're trying to achieve.

**Examples**:
- "Improve customer satisfaction"
- "Increase employee engagement"
- "Make our product easier to use"
- "Reduce support tickets"

### Step 2: Reverse the Goal (2 min)

Flip it to the opposite.

**Reversals**:
- "How do we destroy customer satisfaction?"
- "How do we maximize employee disengagement?"
- "How do we make our product impossible to use?"
- "How do we generate maximum support tickets?"

### Step 3: Brainstorm the Reverse (10-15 min)

Generate ideas for achieving the reversed goal. Be creative and thorough.

**Tips**:
- Think of real-world examples of bad experiences
- Consider every touchpoint
- Go extreme - the worse, the better
- Have fun with it - absurdity is welcome

**Example** ("How to destroy customer satisfaction"):
1. Never respond to emails
2. Make return policy impossible to find
3. Use confusing jargon everywhere
4. Charge hidden fees at checkout
5. Make support phone number a maze
6. Contradict information across pages
7. Ship products late with no tracking
8. Make the website slow and buggy
9. Require account creation to browse
10. Send daily promotional spam
11. Ignore negative reviews
12. Make cancellation require a phone call
13. Use dark patterns everywhere
14. Blame customers for problems
15. Make pricing confusing

### Step 4: Reverse the Ideas (5-10 min)

Flip each bad idea into a good solution.

**Reversals**:
| Make It Worse | Make It Better |
|---------------|----------------|
| Never respond to emails | Respond within 4 hours guaranteed |
| Hidden return policy | Return policy on every product page |
| Confusing jargon | Plain language, tested with users |
| Hidden fees | All-in pricing shown upfront |
| Support maze | Support accessible from every page |
| Contradictory info | Single source of truth, versioned |
| Late shipping, no tracking | Real-time tracking, proactive updates |
| Slow, buggy website | Performance budget, error monitoring |
| Required account | Guest checkout, browse freely |
| Daily spam | Preference center, email only when valuable |
| Ignore reviews | Respond to all reviews within 24h |
| Phone-only cancellation | Self-service cancellation |
| Dark patterns | Clear, honest UX |
| Blame customers | Own problems, apologize genuinely |
| Confusing pricing | Simple, transparent pricing |

### Step 5: Prioritize (5 min)

From your reversed solutions, identify:
- Quick wins (easy to implement, high impact)
- Strategic improvements (harder but valuable)
- New insights (things you hadn't considered)

## Example: Improving Meeting Effectiveness

**Reverse goal**: "How do we make meetings as unproductive as possible?"

**Make it worse**:
1. No agenda - just show up and wing it
2. Invite everyone - all 50 people
3. Start late, run over
4. Let one person dominate
5. No clear decision maker
6. Discuss topics that don't need discussion
7. Never follow up on action items
8. Hold meetings at bad times
9. Make it too long
10. No preparation required
11. Allow constant interruptions
12. Repeat what was said in last meeting
13. Mix strategic and tactical topics
14. End without summarizing decisions

**Make it better**:
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No agenda | Agenda required 24h before, or meeting canceled |
| Invite everyone | Max 6 people, others get summary |
| Start late | Start on time regardless, late arrivals catch up |
| One dominator | Facilitator ensures all voices heard |
| No decision maker | Named decision maker for each topic |
| Unnecessary discussion | Pre-work documents, meeting is for decisions only |
| No follow-up | Action items tracked, reviewed at next meeting |
| Bad timing | No meetings before 10am or after 4pm |
| Too long | Default 25 min, max 50 min |
| No preparation | Pre-read required, quiz at start |
| Interruptions | Phones/laptops away unless taking notes |
| Repetition | Decision log prevents re-litigating |
| Mixed topics | Strategic meetings separate from tactical |
| No summary | Last 5 min always: decisions made, actions assigned |

## Tips for Effective Reverse Brainstorming

### Go extreme
"Make it slightly worse" produces boring ideas. "Make it catastrophically, hilariously worse" produces insights.

### Draw from experience
Think about your worst experiences as a customer, employee, user. What made them terrible?

### Include obvious things
"Don't answer the phone" seems obvious, but the reversal ("answer every call within 3 rings") might be a real improvement.

### Look for patterns
If multiple "make it worse" ideas cluster around a theme, that's a weak area to prioritize.

### Some reversals are hard
If an idea doesn't reverse cleanly, that's okay. The exercise still surfaces the problem.

## Variations

### Reverse Reverse
After reversing bad ideas to good, reverse the good ideas back to bad. Sometimes you find even better solutions in the second pass.

### Competitive Reverse
"How would our worst competitor destroy our business?"
Then reverse to defensive strategies.

### Process Reverse
"How do we make this process take 10x longer and cost 10x more?"
Reveals efficiency opportunities.

### Culture Reverse
"How do we create the most toxic workplace possible?"
Surfaces cultural risks and improvements.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not going negative enough**: Safe "bad ideas" don't produce insights
- **Skipping the reverse**: Getting stuck on problems without solutions
- **Taking it too seriously**: This should be fun and energizing
- **Ignoring revelations**: Sometimes the "bad ideas" reveal actual current problems
- **Weak reversals**: "Don't do that" isn't a solution - be specific about what TO do
