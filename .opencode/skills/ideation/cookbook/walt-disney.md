# Walt Disney Method

Three distinct thinking phases: Dreamer, Realist, and Critic. Named after Walt Disney's creative process, where he reportedly had three different rooms for these three modes of thinking.

## When to Use

- Developing new concepts or projects
- Need both creativity and practicality
- Team tends to criticize ideas too early
- Want balanced evaluation of possibilities
- Time: 30-60 minutes

## The Three Roles

### The Dreamer
**Goal**: Generate possibilities without limits.

**Mindset**:
- "Anything is possible"
- "What if..."
- "Imagine..."
- No constraints exist
- Wild ideas are best

**Questions**:
- What would be the ideal solution?
- What would we do with unlimited resources?
- What's the most exciting possibility?
- What would make this remarkable?
- What would users LOVE?
- What would we do if we couldn't fail?

**Rules**:
- No criticism allowed
- No "that won't work"
- No practical concerns
- Encourage the wildest ideas
- Build on every idea with "Yes, and..."

### The Realist
**Goal**: Turn dreams into actionable plans.

**Mindset**:
- "How do we make this happen?"
- "What would it take?"
- "What are the steps?"
- Practical but still positive
- Solution-focused

**Questions**:
- How would we actually implement this?
- What resources would we need?
- What's the timeline?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What are the concrete steps?
- What does the prototype look like?

**Rules**:
- Take dreams seriously
- Focus on HOW, not WHETHER
- Break into concrete steps
- Identify dependencies
- Stay constructive

### The Critic
**Goal**: Find problems before reality does.

**Mindset**:
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What are we missing?"
- "What if..."
- Constructive skepticism
- Protective, not destructive

**Questions**:
- What are the risks?
- What could fail?
- What haven't we considered?
- Who might object?
- What are the weaknesses?
- What assumptions are we making?

**Rules**:
- Critique the plan, not the dream
- Be specific about concerns
- Identify real risks, not vague doubts
- End with "this would be stronger if..."
- Criticism serves the dream

## The Process

### Phase 1: Dreamer (10-15 min)

Enter the dreamer space completely:

1. State the challenge or opportunity
2. Forget all constraints
3. Generate the most exciting possibilities
4. Aim for quantity - at least 10-15 ideas
5. Build on each other's wild ideas
6. No evaluation whatsoever

**Output**: List of exciting possibilities

### Phase 2: Realist (10-15 min)

Switch to realist mode:

1. Take top 3-5 dreams from Phase 1
2. For each dream, outline implementation:
   - Key steps required
   - Resources needed
   - Timeline estimate
   - Who's involved
3. Make dreams concrete and actionable
4. Identify what's already possible vs. what needs solving

**Output**: Implementation plans for top ideas

### Phase 3: Critic (10-15 min)

Enter critic mode:

1. For each plan, identify:
   - Risks and potential failures
   - Missing elements
   - Weak assumptions
   - Stakeholder concerns
2. Be specific and constructive
3. Frame as "This would be stronger if..."
4. Don't kill ideas - strengthen them

**Output**: Risk assessment and improvement suggestions

### Phase 4: Integration (5-10 min)

Return to all three perspectives:

1. How can we address the critic's concerns?
2. Does this change what's needed from the realist?
3. Does the dreamer have ideas to solve problems?
4. Synthesize into final concept

**Output**: Refined, stress-tested concept

## Solo Walt Disney Method

When working alone:

1. **Physically move** between modes (different seats, rooms, or even just standing vs. sitting)
2. **Use different tools** (whiteboard for dreamer, spreadsheet for realist, red pen for critic)
3. **Complete each phase fully** before moving to next
4. **Set timers** to prevent critic from sneaking into dreamer phase
5. **Write as each persona** - actually write "As the critic, I think..."

## Group Facilitation

**Option 1: Sequential (everyone together)**
- All participants go through Dreamer → Realist → Critic together
- Facilitator manages transitions
- Good for smaller groups

**Option 2: Rotating (assigned roles)**
- Assign 1/3 of group to each role
- Groups rotate through roles
- Each role comments on previous role's output
- Good for larger groups

**Option 3: Physical spaces**
- Three different areas of room (or three rooms)
- Physically move between spaces
- Each space has role-appropriate setup
- Disney's original approach

## Example Session

**Challenge**: Create a better employee onboarding experience

**Dreamer phase**:
- VR tour of the company before first day
- Personal AI assistant that knows everything about the company
- "Buddy" matching based on personality
- Gamified learning with real rewards
- Choose-your-own-adventure first week
- Direct access to CEO for Q&A
- Onboarding retreat at exotic location
- Custom comic book of company history

**Realist phase** (for "AI assistant" idea):
- Build on existing chatbot technology
- Feed it company wiki and policies
- Train on common new-hire questions
- Integrate with Slack for easy access
- Phase 1: FAQ answers (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Personalized recommendations (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Learning path generation (8 weeks)
- Need: NLP expertise, content curator, IT integration

**Critic phase**:
- AI might give wrong answers → Need human review loop
- New hires might rely on it too much → Balance with human connection
- Training data needs constant updating → Assign content owner
- Privacy concerns with questions asked → Clear data policy
- Could feel impersonal → Combine with buddy program
- Cost might be high → Start with simpler FAQ bot

**Integration**:
Final concept: AI assistant + human buddy program, where the AI handles factual questions and the buddy handles culture/relationship building. Start with simple FAQ bot to prove value before investing in advanced features.

## Tips for Effective Sessions

### Commit fully to each role
Half-hearted dreaming produces mediocre ideas. Half-hearted criticism misses real risks.

### Guard the transitions
The most common failure is the critic sneaking into the dreamer phase. Facilitate transitions explicitly.

### Dreamer first, always
Starting with criticism kills creativity. Even if you're "naturally critical," go through dreamer phase first.

### Critic serves the dream
The critic's job is to make ideas stronger, not to kill them. Frame criticism as improvement suggestions.

### Return to dreamer if stuck
If critic identifies problems with no solutions, return to dreamer mode to solve them.

## Common Mistakes

- **Mixing phases**: Criticism during dreaming kills ideas
- **Skipping dreamer**: Starting "realistic" produces boring ideas
- **Destructive criticism**: "That's stupid" vs. "That would be stronger if..."
- **Unequal time**: Critic phase often goes too long
- **Not integrating**: Stopping after criticism instead of improving
