# Feynman Technique Methodology

Test and deepen understanding through simple explanation. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, who believed if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough.

## When to Use

- User thinks they understand but wants to verify
- Complex concept needs simplification
- Identifying hidden knowledge gaps
- Preparing to explain something to others
- Time available: 15-20 minutes per concept

## The Four Steps

### Step 1: Frame the Concept

Identify what the user wants to explain and set the challenge.

**Prompt**:
> "What concept do you want to understand more deeply? Try to explain it to me as if I'm someone curious and intelligent, but completely unfamiliar with this field. No jargon allowed."

**Set constraints**:
- Everyday language only
- Concrete analogies encouraged
- Imagine explaining to a smart 12-year-old

### Step 2: Simple Explanation Attempt

Let the user attempt their explanation. Listen carefully for:

**Watch for these signals**:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "Basically, it just..." | Hand-waving over complexity |
| Jargon creeping in | Gap in fundamental understanding |
| Circular definitions | "X is when you do X" - no real grasp |
| "It's hard to explain" | Found a gap |
| Long pauses | Processing vs. gap recognition |

**Let them finish** - don't interrupt. Note trouble spots mentally.

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

Surface the gaps without judgment. This is diagnostic, not criticism.

**Gap-finding questions**:
- "You said 'basically' before [X] - what's actually happening there?"
- "You used the term [Y] - how would you explain that part without that word?"
- "What happens between [step A] and [step B]?"
- "I noticed you sped through [part] - can you slow down on that piece?"

**Common gap patterns**:
- **Mechanism gaps**: Know what happens, not how
- **Boundary gaps**: Know the concept, not when it doesn't apply
- **Connection gaps**: Understand pieces, not how they relate
- **Foundation gaps**: Missing prerequisite knowledge

### Step 4: Refine and Iterate

Address gaps systematically, then re-explain.

**Process**:
1. Pick the most critical gap (or let user choose)
2. Explore that piece together:
   - "What do you think might be happening here?"
   - Research together if needed
   - Build understanding of that component
3. Attempt explanation again
4. Repeat until smooth

**Success criteria**:
- Can explain without any jargon
- Analogies are accurate (not just catchy)
- No "magic" steps - every transition is clear
- Can answer follow-up "why" questions
- User feels confident, not just compliant

## Adaptation by Level

### For Novices
- Start with smaller scope concepts
- Provide explanation templates/structures
- Help identify gaps (rather than user self-diagnosing)
- More iteration cycles expected

### For Advanced Learners
- Larger, more complex concepts
- User identifies own gaps
- Push for multiple explanation styles
- Challenge with edge cases after success

## Example Session

**User**: "I want to understand how HTTPS works"

**Teacher**: "Great. Explain HTTPS to me as if I'm a curious person who knows what websites are, but nothing about security or encryption."

**User**: "So when you visit a website with HTTPS, your browser and the server do a handshake where they exchange keys... and then everything is encrypted so no one can read it."

**Teacher**: "I noticed you said 'exchange keys' - if I'm listening to the conversation, wouldn't I also see those keys being exchanged?"

**User**: "Oh... hmm. That's a good point. I know there's something with public and private keys but I'm not sure how that solves the problem."

**Teacher**: "You found a gap. What do you think the difference between a public and private key might be?"

**User**: "Maybe... the public key can only encrypt, and the private key can only decrypt? So even if someone sees the public key, they can't use it to read messages?"

**Teacher**: "You're on the right track. Can you try explaining the handshake again with that idea?"

[Iteration continues until explanation flows smoothly]

## Common Pitfalls

- **Accepting jargon** - Letting technical terms slide undermines the technique
- **Rushing to "correct"** - The gap IS the learning opportunity
- **Settling for "close enough"** - Partial explanations hide partial understanding
- **Skipping iteration** - One pass rarely achieves deep understanding

## The Meta-Skill

The real goal isn't just understanding one concept - it's developing the habit of self-testing through explanation. Users who internalize this technique can apply it independently forever.
