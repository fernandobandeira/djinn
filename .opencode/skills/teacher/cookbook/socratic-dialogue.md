# Socratic Dialogue Methodology

Guide users to discover knowledge through strategic questioning. The goal is for the learner to reach insights independently, building genuine understanding and ownership.

## When to Use

- User wants to explore a concept deeply
- Building critical thinking skills matters
- User should own the discovery process
- Time for a thoughtful conversation (10-20 minutes)

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 questions)

Establish what the user already knows. Start with genuine curiosity.

**Opening questions**:
- "What do you already know about [topic]?"
- "What made you curious about this?"
- "Where have you encountered this before?"
- "What's your current thinking on this?"

**Set expectations**:
- "I'll ask questions to help you explore this"
- "You'll figure this out through your own reasoning"
- "There are no wrong answers, only thinking opportunities"

### Phase 2: Systematic Questioning (4-8 questions)

Progress through question types. Don't rush - let each answer develop fully.

#### 2A. Clarification Questions
Build precision in thinking.

- "What exactly do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How does that relate to what you said earlier?"
- "Could you rephrase that in different words?"

**Success indicators**: Increased precision, spontaneous elaboration

#### 2B. Assumption Questions
Reveal hidden assumptions and beliefs.

- "What assumptions might you be making here?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Is that always the case?"
- "Why do you think that's true?"

**Success indicators**: Recognition of hidden assumptions, intellectual humility

#### 2C. Evidence Questions
Strengthen reasoning quality.

- "What evidence supports that thinking?"
- "How might someone disagree with this?"
- "What would change your mind?"
- "How could we test this?"

**Success indicators**: Evidence-based reasoning, openness to counterarguments

#### 2D. Perspective Questions
Expand viewpoint and implications.

- "What's another way to look at this?"
- "What would [different stakeholder] say?"
- "What follows from this reasoning?"
- "How does this apply in [different context]?"

**Success indicators**: Multiple perspectives considered, transfer thinking

### Phase 3: Discovery Consolidation

Help the user synthesize their discoveries.

**Consolidation questions**:
- "Based on our discussion, what's your understanding now?"
- "What surprised you in this exploration?"
- "How did your thinking change?"
- "What new questions do you have?"

**Signs of success**:
- Learner reaches conclusions independently
- Genuine "aha!" moments occur
- New questions spontaneously emerge
- Confidence in reasoning process grows

## Pacing Guidelines

- **One question at a time** - let responses fully develop
- **Wait for genuine thinking** - silence is productive
- **If stuck, hint with another question** - not direct answers
- **Celebrate insights** - acknowledge good reasoning

## Adaptation by Level

### For Novices
- Softer challenge, more affirmation
- Stay with concrete examples before abstraction
- Provide more scaffolding between questions

### For Advanced Learners
- Move through sequence more quickly
- Use complex, multi-faceted scenarios
- Let learner drive question directions
- Focus on edge cases and limitations

## Example Dialogue

**User**: "Help me understand how git branches work"

**Teacher**: "What do you already know about branches?"

**User**: "They're like... copies of the code?"

**Teacher**: "Interesting. When you create a branch, do you think it actually copies all the files?"

**User**: "I assumed so... but that would be slow and wasteful."

**Teacher**: "What might be a more efficient approach?"

**User**: "Maybe it just tracks what's different? Like a pointer to where you started plus the changes?"

**Teacher**: "You're onto something. If it's just tracking differences, what would that mean for switching between branches?"

**User**: "Oh! That's why it's so fast to switch - it's not copying files, just changing what version it's pointing to!"

**Teacher**: "Exactly. What questions does that raise about what happens when branches need to come back together?"

## Common Pitfalls

- **Leading questions** - Questions that telegraph the "right" answer
- **Impatience** - Moving on before genuine understanding
- **Interrogation mode** - Too many questions without connection
- **Rescuing too quickly** - Jumping in when learner struggles

**Remember**: The goal is discovery, not efficiency. A longer path to genuine understanding beats a shortcut to surface familiarity.
