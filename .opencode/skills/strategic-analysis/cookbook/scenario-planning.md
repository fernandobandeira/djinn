# Scenario Planning

Develop multiple plausible futures to stress-test strategies and prepare for uncertainty. Originally developed at Shell Oil in the 1970s.

## When to Use

- High uncertainty about the future
- Long-term strategic planning
- Major investment decisions
- Industry disruption possible
- Need strategies robust across futures
- Time: 2-4 hours (full process)

## The Core Idea

Don't predict the future - prepare for multiple futures.

Scenarios are NOT:
- Forecasts (single prediction)
- Wishes (desired future)
- Best/worst cases (too simplistic)

Scenarios ARE:
- Plausible alternative futures
- Internally consistent stories
- Tools for stress-testing strategies

## The 2x2 Scenario Matrix

The most common approach: identify two critical uncertainties and create four scenarios.

```
                    Uncertainty A
                    High ←────────────→ Low
              ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
    High      │                 │                 │
              │   Scenario 1    │   Scenario 2    │
Uncertainty   │                 │                 │
    B         ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
              │                 │                 │
    Low       │   Scenario 3    │   Scenario 4    │
              │                 │                 │
              └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## The Process

### Step 1: Define the Focal Question (15 min)

What decision or strategy are you testing?

**Good focal questions**:
- "What should our product strategy be for the next 5 years?"
- "Should we expand into market X?"
- "How should we position against potential disruption?"

**Bad focal questions**:
- "What will happen?" (too vague)
- "Will we succeed?" (yes/no doesn't help)

### Step 2: Identify Driving Forces (30 min)

List forces that could shape the future:

**Categories to explore**:
- Social/demographic trends
- Technology changes
- Economic factors
- Environmental factors
- Political/regulatory changes
- Industry dynamics

**Generate 15-20 forces**, then filter to most important.

### Step 3: Rank by Importance and Uncertainty (20 min)

Plot forces on a matrix:

```
             High Importance
                    │
       Include in   │   CRITICAL
       scenarios    │   UNCERTAINTIES
                    │   (Use for axes)
    ────────────────┼────────────────
                    │
       Probably     │   Monitor but
       ignore       │   don't build
                    │   scenarios around
             Low Importance
    Low Uncertainty      High Uncertainty
```

Select 2 critical uncertainties for your scenario axes.

### Step 4: Build Scenario Frameworks (30 min)

Create the 2x2 matrix with your two uncertainties.

**Example**: Planning for a SaaS company

- Uncertainty A: AI capability advancement (Slow ↔ Rapid)
- Uncertainty B: Economic environment (Recession ↔ Growth)

```
                    AI Advancement
                    Slow ←────────────→ Rapid
              ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
    Growth    │   "Steady       │   "AI Boom"     │
              │   Climb"        │                 │
Economy       ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
              │   "Stagnation"  │   "Efficiency   │
    Recession │                 │   Imperative"   │
              └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Step 5: Develop Scenario Narratives (45 min)

For each scenario, write a 1-2 page story:

**Include**:
- Vivid name that captures the essence
- How we got here (chain of events)
- What the world looks like
- Key characteristics and indicators
- Implications for your focal question

**Example narrative opening**:

> **"Efficiency Imperative" (2029)**
> The recession of 2026 proved deeper than expected, lasting 18 months. Meanwhile, AI capabilities advanced rapidly - GPT-7 and its competitors could now handle 80% of routine knowledge work. Companies under margin pressure raced to adopt AI to cut costs. Our enterprise customers slashed headcounts but increased software spending on automation. The survivors are lean and AI-native...

### Step 6: Test Strategies Against Scenarios (30 min)

For each strategy option, ask:
- Does this work in Scenario 1? 2? 3? 4?
- What would we need to change?
- What's the downside if this scenario happens?

**Strategy robustness matrix**:

| Strategy | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Option A | Works well | Struggles | Works OK | Fails |
| Option B | Works OK | Works well | Works well | Works OK |
| Option C | Fails | Works well | Struggles | Works well |

**Option B is most robust** - works reasonably across all futures.

### Step 7: Identify Early Warning Indicators (15 min)

What signals would tell us which scenario is unfolding?

| Scenario | Early Indicators |
|----------|------------------|
| AI Boom | AI investment up 50%+ YoY, major product launches |
| Efficiency Imperative | Recession declared, AI-driven layoffs accelerate |
| Steady Climb | GDP growth 2-3%, AI adoption gradual |
| Stagnation | Prolonged low growth, AI progress slows |

Monitor these to trigger strategy adjustments.

## Tips for Better Scenarios

### Choose orthogonal uncertainties
Your two axes should be independent - one shouldn't cause the other.

### Make scenarios vivid
Names and narratives help people remember and use them.

### Avoid good/bad framing
Each scenario should have opportunities and challenges.

### Include surprises
What could happen that would catch everyone off-guard?

### Revisit regularly
Update scenarios as the future unfolds.

## Common Mistakes

- **Forecasting disguised as scenarios**: Single "most likely" future isn't scenario planning
- **Best case / worst case**: Too simplistic, misses the nuance
- **Too many scenarios**: 4 is ideal, more than 6 is unusable
- **Correlated uncertainties**: If A causes B, they're not independent
- **No action implications**: Scenarios must connect to strategy
- **One and done**: Scenarios need updating as reality unfolds
