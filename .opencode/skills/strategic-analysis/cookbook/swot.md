### Strengths (Internal, Helpful)
What do we do well? What advantages do we have?

**Questions to ask**:
- What are we better at than competitors?
- What unique resources do we have?
- What do others see as our strengths?
- What's working well right now?
- What expertise or capabilities are distinctive?

**Examples**:
- Strong brand recognition
- Proprietary technology
- Skilled team in specific area
- Low cost structure
- Strong customer relationships

### Weaknesses (Internal, Harmful)
What could we improve? What do we lack?

**Questions to ask**:
- What do competitors do better?
- What resources are we lacking?
- What do others see as our weaknesses?
- What's not working well?
- Where do we lose to competitors?

**Examples**:
- Limited marketing budget
- Gaps in team expertise
- Technical debt
- Weak in specific market segment
- Dependencies on single customer/vendor

### Opportunities (External, Helpful)
What external factors could we exploit?

**Questions to ask**:
- What trends could benefit us?
- What market changes create openings?
- What are competitors neglecting?
- What regulatory changes help us?
- What new technologies enable us?

**Examples**:
- Market growing rapidly
- Competitor exiting the space
- New platform/channel emerging
- Regulatory change favoring our approach
- Partnership possibilities

### Threats (External, Harmful)
What external factors could harm us?

**Questions to ask**:
- What trends could hurt us?
- What are competitors doing?
- What market changes threaten us?
- What regulatory risks exist?
- What could make us obsolete?

**Examples**:
- New competitor with funding
- Technology shift undermining our approach
- Economic downturn affecting customers
- Regulatory changes adding costs
- Key talent being poached

## Running a SWOT Session

### Solo Process (30 min)

1. **Define the focus** (2 min): What decision/situation are you analyzing?
2. **Brainstorm each quadrant** (5 min each, 20 min total): List 5-10 items per quadrant
3. **Prioritize** (5 min): Mark top 3 in each quadrant
4. **Develop strategies** (3 min): How do strengths address threats? How do opportunities offset weaknesses?

### Group Process (60 min)

1. **Align on objective** (5 min): What are we analyzing?
2. **Individual brainstorm** (10 min): Everyone fills their own SWOT
3. **Share and consolidate** (20 min): Combine into master SWOT
4. **Vote on priorities** (10 min): Each person votes for top 3 per quadrant
5. **Strategy discussion** (15 min): Develop strategic responses

## SWOT-to-Strategy Matrix

After completing SWOT, develop strategies at intersections:

| | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|
| **Opportunities** | **SO Strategies**: Use strengths to capture opportunities | **WO Strategies**: Address weaknesses to capture opportunities |
| **Threats** | **ST Strategies**: Use strengths to counter threats | **WT Strategies**: Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats |

### Example Strategies

**SO (Strength + Opportunity)**: "Our strong engineering team (S) can build features for the emerging API-first market (O)"

**WO (Weakness + Opportunity)**: "Partner with a marketing firm (address W) to capitalize on growing market demand (O)"

**ST (Strength + Threat)**: "Our brand reputation (S) helps us retain customers despite new competitor (T)"

**WT (Weakness + Threat)**: "Outsource non-core functions (minimize W) to reduce exposure to cost pressures (T)"

## Tips for Better SWOT

### Be specific
"Strong team" is too vague. "3 engineers with ML expertise" is actionable.

### Get outside perspective
Your blind spots are real. Ask customers, partners, outsiders.

### Challenge categorization
Is something really a strength, or are you assuming? Test against evidence.

### Don't ignore the uncomfortable
Weaknesses and threats are often understated. Push for honesty.

### Connect to action
SWOT without strategy is just an exercise. Every analysis should lead to "so what?"

## Common Mistakes

- **Listing facts, not insights**: "We have 50 employees" isn't a strength or weakness without context
- **Confusing internal/external**: "Market is growing" is opportunity (external), not strength (internal)
- **Wishful thinking**: Listing desired state, not actual state
- **Unbalanced analysis**: 15 strengths, 2 weaknesses = bias, not reality
- **No prioritization**: Long lists without focus on what matters most
- **Analysis stops at the matrix**: SWOT should lead to strategy, not just awareness
