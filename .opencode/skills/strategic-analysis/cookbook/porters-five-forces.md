Each force affects your ability to serve customers and earn profits.

## Force 1: Industry Rivalry

How intensely do existing competitors compete?

### High Rivalry When:
- Many competitors of similar size
- Slow industry growth
- High fixed costs (pressure to fill capacity)
- Low differentiation (compete on price)
- High exit barriers (stuck in the industry)
- Diverse competitors with different strategies

### Assessment Questions:
- How many direct competitors exist?
- Are they similar in size and capability?
- Is the industry growing, stable, or declining?
- How differentiated are offerings?
- How often do price wars occur?
- What are the exit barriers?

### Rivalry Signals:
| Low Rivalry | High Rivalry |
|-------------|--------------|
| Few competitors | Many competitors |
| Rapid growth | Slow/no growth |
| Differentiated products | Commodity products |
| High switching costs | Easy switching |
| Low fixed costs | High fixed costs |

## Force 2: Threat of New Entrants

How easy is it for new players to enter?

### Barriers to Entry:
- **Economies of scale**: Large players have cost advantages
- **Capital requirements**: High investment needed to compete
- **Switching costs**: Customers locked into existing solutions
- **Access to distribution**: Channels controlled by incumbents
- **Proprietary technology**: Patents, trade secrets, know-how
- **Government policy**: Licenses, regulations, standards
- **Brand identity**: Established trust and recognition

### Assessment Questions:
- How much capital is needed to enter?
- Are there patents or proprietary advantages?
- Do incumbents have cost advantages?
- How strong is brand loyalty?
- Are distribution channels accessible?
- What regulatory barriers exist?

### Entry Barrier Signals:
| Low Barriers | High Barriers |
|--------------|---------------|
| Low capital needs | Massive investment required |
| No patents/IP | Strong IP protection |
| Easy distribution | Locked distribution |
| Weak brands | Powerful brands |
| No regulations | Heavy licensing |

## Force 3: Threat of Substitutes

What alternatives could customers switch to?

### Substitutes are Threatening When:
- Price-performance is attractive
- Switching costs are low
- Buyers are willing to substitute
- Substitute is improving rapidly

### Assessment Questions:
- What other ways can customers solve this problem?
- How do substitute prices compare?
- What are the switching costs?
- How loyal are customers to current solution type?
- Are substitutes improving faster than our industry?

### Substitute Signals:
| Low Threat | High Threat |
|------------|-------------|
| No real alternatives | Multiple alternatives |
| Substitutes expensive | Substitutes competitive |
| High switching costs | Easy to switch |
| Strong preference | Willing to try new |

### Example Substitutes:
- Video conferencing substitutes for business travel
- Streaming substitutes for cable TV
- Smartphones substitute for cameras, GPS, music players
- AI tools substitute for various professional services

## Force 4: Bargaining Power of Suppliers

How much leverage do suppliers have over you?

### Suppliers are Powerful When:
- Few suppliers (concentrated)
- No substitutes for their input
- Your industry isn't important to them
- High switching costs between suppliers
- Suppliers could integrate forward
- You can't integrate backward

### Assessment Questions:
- How many suppliers are there?
- How unique is their product/service?
- What would it cost to switch suppliers?
- Could the supplier become a competitor?
- How important is our business to them?

### Supplier Power Signals:
| Low Power | High Power |
|-----------|------------|
| Many suppliers | Few suppliers |
| Commodity inputs | Unique inputs |
| Easy to switch | Locked in |
| Important customer | Small customer |
| Could integrate | Can't integrate |

## Force 5: Bargaining Power of Buyers

How much leverage do customers have over you?

### Buyers are Powerful When:
- Few buyers or large volume purchases
- Products are undifferentiated
- Switching costs are low
- Buyer could integrate backward
- Product isn't important to buyer's quality
- Buyer has full information

### Assessment Questions:
- How concentrated are buyers?
- How price-sensitive are they?
- What are their switching costs?
- Could they make this themselves?
- How important is our product to them?
- How informed are they?

### Buyer Power Signals:
| Low Power | High Power |
|-----------|------------|
| Many small buyers | Few large buyers |
| Differentiated product | Commodity |
| High switching costs | Easy to switch |
| Critical to buyer | Non-essential |
| Information asymmetry | Full transparency |

## Running a Five Forces Analysis

### Process (60-90 min)

1. **Define industry boundaries** (10 min)
   - What industry are you analyzing?
   - Where do you draw the lines?

2. **Analyze each force** (10 min each, 50 min)
   - Rate: Strong (5) to Weak (1)
   - List specific factors
   - Identify trends (getting stronger/weaker?)

3. **Synthesize** (15 min)
   - Which forces are most significant?
   - Where are the profit pools?
   - What's changing?

4. **Strategic implications** (15 min)
   - How can we position against forces?
   - Which forces can we influence?
   - Where should we compete?

## Strategic Responses to Forces

| Force | Response Options |
|-------|------------------|
| High Rivalry | Differentiate, focus on niche, acquire competitors |
| New Entrants | Raise barriers, build brand, lock in customers |
| Substitutes | Improve value, match substitute benefits, acquire |
| Supplier Power | Diversify suppliers, integrate backward, partner |
| Buyer Power | Differentiate, find less powerful segments, lock-in |

## Common Mistakes

- **Too broad industry definition**: "Technology" isn't an industry
- **Ignoring indirect substitutes**: Don't just look at direct competitors
- **Static analysis**: Forces change - analyze trends
- **Forgetting the "so what"**: Analysis should drive strategy
- **Only looking at current state**: Consider how forces are evolving
- **Confusing forces**: Rivalry is existing competitors, entrants are potential
