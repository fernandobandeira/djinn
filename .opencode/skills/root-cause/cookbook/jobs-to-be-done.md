# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

Understand what users are really trying to accomplish, not what they say they want. People don't buy products - they hire them to do jobs. Focus on the job, not the solution.

## When to Use

- Understanding user needs for product development
- Figuring out why users adopt (or don't adopt) solutions
- Finding innovation opportunities
- Escaping feature-comparison thinking
- Time: 20-40 minutes

## Core Concept

**The insight**: People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They don't even want a quarter-inch hole. They want to hang a picture. Maybe they want to make their home feel personal. The "job" is at the level of the outcome they care about.

**The framework**:
> When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].

All three parts matter:
- **Situation**: The triggering context
- **Motivation**: What they're trying to do
- **Outcome**: The ultimate goal they care about

## The Process

### Step 1: Identify the Job

Look beyond the product to what users are trying to accomplish.

**Questions to find the job**:
- "What were you trying to accomplish when you [used our product]?"
- "What would you have done if this solution didn't exist?"
- "What does success look like?"
- "What happens after you complete this task?"

**Moving up the job ladder**:
| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Task | Send an email |
| Activity | Communicate with colleague |
| Job | Stay aligned on project |
| Outcome | Successfully complete project |
| Aspiration | Be valued at work |

Usually the job is 2-3 levels above the task.

### Step 2: Map the Job's Dimensions

Jobs have functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

**Functional job**: What task are they trying to complete?
- "Get from point A to point B"
- "Organize my thoughts"
- "Track expenses"

**Emotional job**: How do they want to feel?
- "Feel confident I won't forget anything"
- "Feel in control of my finances"
- "Feel less anxious about the presentation"

**Social job**: How do they want to be perceived?
- "Look prepared to my boss"
- "Seem sophisticated to friends"
- "Appear professional to clients"

**Complete job statement**:
> When [preparing for a presentation], I want to [organize my key points] so I can [deliver confidently] and [appear knowledgeable to my audience].

### Step 3: Understand Hiring Criteria

What makes someone "hire" or "fire" a solution for this job?

**Hiring triggers** (why they start using something):
- Situation changed (new job, new problem)
- Old solution stopped working
- Discovered new possibility
- Pain became unbearable

**Firing triggers** (why they stop):
- Job changed or went away
- Found better solution
- Too much friction
- Emotional need unmet

**Switching costs** (why they stay with current solution):
- Learning curve of new solution
- Data/history in current solution
- Habits and familiarity
- Social pressure

### Step 4: Identify Job Competitors

Competition isn't just similar products - it's anything people hire for the same job.

**Example**: Job = "feel more awake in the morning"
- Coffee (product category you might think of)
- Energy drinks
- Exercise
- Cold shower
- Going to bed earlier
- Stimulating news/social media
- Doing nothing (accepting tiredness)

**Questions**:
- "What did you use before our product?"
- "What would you do if our product disappeared?"
- "What else do you use for this purpose?"

### Step 5: Define Success Metrics

How does the user measure whether the job is done well?

**Speed**: How quickly can I get this done?
**Quality**: How well is the outcome achieved?
**Reliability**: Can I count on this working?
**Convenience**: How much effort does it take?
**Cost**: What does it cost me (money, time, social)?
**Experience**: How does it feel to do this?

**Job metrics template**:
| Metric | User Definition | Current Performance | Desired Performance |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Speed | [How they think about it] | [Current state] | [Goal state] |

## Example: Job Analysis for Note-Taking App

**Initial view**: Users want note-taking features (folders, tags, search)

**JTBD Analysis**:

**Job**: "When I encounter interesting information, I want to capture and organize it so I can find and use it later when relevant."

**Dimensions**:
- Functional: Capture quickly, find later
- Emotional: Feel secure that good ideas aren't lost
- Social: Appear well-prepared and knowledgeable

**Competitors**:
- Other note apps
- Bookmarking
- Screenshots
- Sending to self via email
- Memory (doing nothing)
- Telling someone else

**Success metrics**:
- Can I capture without interrupting my flow?
- Can I find it when I need it (not just when I look)?
- Do my notes actually get used or just accumulate?

**Insights**:
- "Find it when I need it" suggests surfacing, not just search
- "Without interrupting flow" means speed matters more than organization
- "Actually get used" means retrieval context matters
- Real competition is "memory + doing nothing" - very low friction

## Tips for JTBD Analysis

### Talk about specific instances
Not "how do you usually..." but "tell me about the last time you..."

### Watch for workarounds
What awkward things do people do? Workarounds reveal unmet jobs.

### Listen for struggling moments
"The hard part is..." and "I wish I could..." reveal job friction.

### The job is stable, solutions change
"Get from A to B" hasn't changed. Horse → car → Uber → autonomous vehicles.

### Don't ask what they want
Ask what they're trying to accomplish. Users are experts on problems, not solutions.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing task with job**: "Send email" is task; "stay aligned with team" is job
- **Ignoring emotional/social**: Functional job alone misses why people really choose
- **Narrow competitive view**: Only comparing to "similar" products
- **Assuming you know the job**: Actually talk to users, don't guess
- **Static job definition**: Jobs evolve with context and capability
