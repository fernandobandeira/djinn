# Design Critique

Systematically evaluate designs to identify what works, what doesn't, and how to improve. Good critique separates personal preference from user-centered feedback.

## When to Use

- Reviewing design concepts or mockups
- Iterating on existing designs
- Getting stakeholder feedback structured
- Making design decisions with evidence
- Improving team design culture
- Time: 30-45 minutes per session

## Critique vs Criticism

| Critique | Criticism |
|----------|-----------|
| Objective, based on goals | Subjective, based on preference |
| "This doesn't support the user goal because..." | "I don't like this" |
| Actionable feedback | Vague reactions |
| Focuses on the work | Focuses on the person |
| Opens discussion | Shuts down discussion |

## The Process

### Step 1: Set Context (5 min)

Before showing designs, establish:

```markdown
**Design Context**
- User: [Who is this for?]
- Goal: [What are they trying to accomplish?]
- Scenario: [When/where will they use this?]
- Constraints: [Technical, brand, time limitations]
- Feedback focus: [Specific areas you want reviewed]
```

### Step 2: Present Without Defending (5 min)

Designer presents the work:
- Walk through the design flow
- Explain key decisions briefly
- Point out areas of uncertainty
- **Don't justify or defend** - let the work speak

### Step 3: Silent Review (3 min)

Reviewers examine silently:
- No discussion yet
- Each person notes observations
- Prevents groupthink and anchoring

### Step 4: Structured Feedback (20 min)

Go around with each category:

**What's Working** (5 min)
- "This supports the user goal because..."
- "I noticed [element] which makes [task] clearer"
- "The [pattern] is consistent with user expectations"

**What's Not Working** (10 min)
- "Users might struggle with [element] because..."
- "This doesn't account for [scenario]"
- "The [element] competes with [other element] for attention"

**What If** (5 min)
- "What if we tried [alternative]?"
- "Have we considered [different approach]?"
- "What would happen if [constraint changed]?"

### Step 5: Capture and Prioritize (5 min)

Document key points and decide:
- What needs immediate action?
- What needs more exploration?
- What's out of scope for now?

## Critique Questions by Focus Area

### Information Architecture
- Is the hierarchy clear?
- Can users find what they need?
- Are labels understandable?
- Is navigation predictable?

### Visual Design
- Does it establish clear hierarchy?
- Is there appropriate contrast?
- Does spacing feel balanced?
- Is it consistent with the system?

### Interaction Design
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Is feedback clear and timely?
- Are error states handled?
- Does the flow feel natural?

### Content
- Is the copy clear and concise?
- Does it match user mental models?
- Are microcopy and labels helpful?
- Is the tone appropriate?

### Accessibility
- Is there sufficient contrast?
- Are touch targets large enough?
- Does it work without color?
- Can it be navigated by keyboard?

## Critique Session Template

```markdown

**Designer**: [Name]
**Reviewers**: [Names]

### Context
- **User**: [Persona or user type]
- **Goal**: [What user is trying to accomplish]
- **Stage**: [Concept / Wireframe / High-fidelity / Final]
- **Focus areas**: [Specific areas to review]

### What's Working
1. [Observation] - [Why it works for users]
2. [Observation] - [Why it works for users]

### What's Not Working
1. [Issue] - [Impact on users] - [Severity: High/Med/Low]
2. [Issue] - [Impact on users] - [Severity: High/Med/Low]

### What If (Alternatives to Explore)
1. [Alternative approach] - [Potential trade-off]
2. [Alternative approach] - [Potential trade-off]

### Action Items
| Item | Owner | Priority | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| [Action] | [Name] | [H/M/L] | [Status] |

### Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

### Open Questions
- [Question needing more research]
```

## Running Remote Critique

When in-person isn't possible:

1. **Share designs in advance** - Give reviewers 10 min to review async
2. **Use annotation tools** - Figma comments, Miro, Loom
3. **Structure strictly** - Time-box each section
4. **One voice at a time** - Use raise-hand or round-robin
5. **Record key points** - Shared doc visible to all

## Tips for Better Critique

### For Presenters
- Don't defend - listen first
- Take notes on all feedback
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be specific about what feedback you need
- Thank reviewers for honesty

### For Reviewers
- Ground feedback in user goals
- Be specific, not vague ("this button" not "some things")
- Suggest alternatives, don't just identify problems
- Separate must-fix from nice-to-have
- Praise what works, not just problems

### For Facilitators
- Keep time strictly
- Redirect personal preferences to user goals
- Ensure everyone speaks
- Capture action items in real-time
- Follow up on decisions made

## Common Mistakes

- **Design by committee**: Trying to incorporate all feedback
- **Preference masquerading as critique**: "I don't like blue" vs "Blue doesn't have enough contrast"
- **Defending instead of listening**: Justifying every decision
- **Critiquing too late**: When changes are expensive
- **Skipping context**: Reviewers don't understand constraints
- **Vague feedback**: "Make it pop" without specifics
- **No follow-through**: Critique without action items
