# Interview Design

Plan and conduct user interviews that uncover genuine insights. The goal isn't to confirm your ideas - it's to understand users deeply.

## When to Use

- Early discovery (what problem to solve?)
- Understanding context and motivations
- Exploring "why" behind behaviors
- Following up on surprising survey results
- When you need rich, qualitative data
- Time: 30-60 min per interview, 5-10 interviews minimum

## Interview Types

| Type | Duration | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Discovery** | 45-60 min | Understanding problems, context, needs |
| **Usability** | 30-45 min | Observing product interaction |
| **Contextual** | 60-90 min | Observing in natural environment |
| **Expert** | 30-45 min | Domain knowledge, industry insight |

## The Process

### Step 1: Define Research Questions (30 min)

What do you need to learn? (Not what to ask - what to learn)

**Good research questions**:
- How do users currently solve this problem?
- What frustrates them about existing solutions?
- What would make them switch to a new solution?
- How do they evaluate options in this category?

**Bad research questions**:
- "Do users like our product?" (leading)
- "What features do users want?" (too direct)
- "Will users pay for this?" (hypothetical)

### Step 2: Create Interview Guide (45 min)

Structure your conversation:

```markdown
## Interview Guide: [Research Topic]

### Opening (5 min)
- Thank them, explain purpose
- Get permission to record
- Remind them: no wrong answers

### Warm-up (5 min)
- Tell me about your role
- Walk me through a typical day

### Core Questions (30-40 min)

**Topic 1: Current behavior**
- How do you currently [do the thing]?
- Walk me through the last time you [did the thing]
- What tools do you use for [activity]?

**Topic 2: Pain points**
- What's the hardest part about [activity]?
- Tell me about a time when [activity] didn't go well
- What do you wish was easier?

**Topic 3: Solutions attempted**
- What have you tried to solve this?
- What worked? What didn't?
- Why did you stop using [previous solution]?

### Wrap-up (5 min)
- Is there anything I should have asked?
- Anyone else I should talk to?
- Thank them
```

### Step 3: Recruit Participants (varies)

**Who to recruit**:
- Current users (understand actual behavior)
- Churned users (understand why they left)
- Prospects (understand decision process)
- Non-users (understand barriers)

**How many**: 5-8 per segment. Patterns emerge around interview 5.

**Screening criteria**:
- Demographics that matter
- Behavior qualifications (has done X recently)
- Exclusions (competitors, employees, recent participants)

### Step 4: Conduct Interviews

**Before**:
- Test recording equipment
- Review the guide (don't read it verbatim)
- Prepare for note-taking

**During**:
- Start recording (with permission)
- Follow the guide loosely - follow interesting threads
- Listen more than you talk (aim for 80/20)
- Ask follow-ups: "Tell me more about that"
- Watch for body language and emotion

**After**:
- Write summary immediately while fresh
- Note surprising findings
- Update guide if needed for next interview

## Question Techniques

### Open-ended questions
Get them talking, not answering yes/no.

| Instead of... | Ask... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Do you like X?" | "How do you feel about X?" |
| "Is this useful?" | "How would you use this?" |
| "Would you pay for this?" | "How do you budget for tools like this?" |

### Story-based questions
Get concrete examples, not generalizations.

| Instead of... | Ask... |
|---------------|--------|
| "What do you usually do?" | "Walk me through the last time you did this" |
| "What's important to you?" | "Tell me about a time when you chose between options" |
| "What problems do you have?" | "Describe a recent frustration with this" |

### Follow-up questions
Dig deeper into interesting responses.

- "Tell me more about that"
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Why was that [frustrating/helpful/surprising]?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

### Silence
The most powerful technique. After they answer, wait 3-5 seconds. They'll often elaborate.

## What NOT to Ask

### Leading questions
❌ "Don't you think this feature would be useful?"
✅ "How would you approach this task?"

### Hypotheticals
❌ "Would you use a product that does X?"
✅ "How do you currently solve X?"

### Future predictions
❌ "How often would you use this?"
✅ "How often did you do this in the last month?"

### Double questions
❌ "How do you find products and what makes you choose one?"
✅ Ask each separately

### Jargon
❌ "How do you manage your workflow orchestration?"
✅ "How do you keep track of what needs to get done?"

## Interview Guide Template

```markdown
## Interview Guide

**Research objective**: [What we're trying to learn]
**Participant criteria**: [Who we're talking to]
**Duration**: [X minutes]

### Introduction (3 min)

"Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today. I'm [name] and I'm doing research to understand [topic]. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm just trying to learn from your experience.

Is it okay if I record this? The recording is just for my notes and won't be shared publicly.

Do you have any questions before we start?"

### Warm-up (5 min)

1. Tell me a bit about yourself and what you do.
2. [Relevant context question]

### Section 1: [Topic] (X min)

1. [Question]
   - Follow-up: [Probe]
   - Follow-up: [Probe]

2. [Question]
   - Follow-up: [Probe]

### Section 2: [Topic] (X min)

[Same structure]

### Section 3: [Topic] (X min)

[Same structure]

### Wrap-up (3 min)

1. Is there anything else about [topic] that I should know?
2. Who else should I talk to about this?
3. Thank you so much for your time!

### Notes for interviewer
- Key things to listen for: [...]
- If they mention X, probe on: [...]
- Don't forget to ask about: [...]
```

## Analyzing Interviews

### During/immediately after
- Highlight key quotes
- Note surprises and patterns
- Tag by theme

### After all interviews
- Affinity mapping: Group similar findings
- Look for patterns across participants
- Identify outliers and why they differ
- Synthesize into insights

### Insight format
**Observation**: [What we saw/heard]
**Implication**: [What it means]
**Opportunity**: [What we might do]

## Tips for Better Interviews

### Build rapport first
Spend time on warm-up. Relaxed participants share more.

### Embrace silence
Resist filling pauses. Let them think.

### Follow the energy
If they light up about something, explore it - even if off-script.

### Watch for inconsistencies
"I always..." but earlier they described doing something different. Probe gently.

### Don't defend or explain
If they criticize your product, don't argue. Ask more.

## Common Mistakes

- **Talking too much**: You should talk 20%, listen 80%
- **Leading the witness**: Phrasing that suggests "right" answer
- **Accepting surface answers**: Not digging into "why"
- **Sticking rigidly to script**: Missing interesting tangents
- **Confirming hypotheses**: Seeking validation, not truth
- **Not recording**: You'll forget important details
- **Waiting to analyze**: Notes decay quickly; synthesize fast
