# Journey Mapping

Visualize the complete user experience across touchpoints and time. Reveal pain points, opportunities, and emotional moments that data alone can't show.

## When to Use

- Understanding end-to-end user experience
- Finding pain points across touchpoints
- Aligning team on user perspective
- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Onboarding or conversion optimization
- Time: 1-3 hours (depending on complexity)

## The Process

### Step 1: Define Scope (15 min)

**Choose your lens**:

| Lens | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| Current state | Understanding existing experience |
| Future state | Designing ideal experience |
| Day in the life | Broader context beyond your product |
| Service blueprint | Internal processes behind the experience |

**Define boundaries**:
- Which persona/user type?
- What scenario/goal?
- Where does the journey start and end?

### Step 2: Identify Stages (15 min)

Break the journey into phases the user goes through.

**Common stage models**:

**Purchase journey**:
Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Purchase → Post-Purchase

**Product adoption**:
Discovery → Evaluation → Signup → Onboarding → Regular Use → Expansion/Churn

**Support journey**:
Issue Occurs → Seek Help → Contact Support → Resolution → Follow-up

**Custom stages** based on your specific journey work too.

### Step 3: Map User Actions (20 min)

For each stage, list what the user DOES:

**Questions to ask**:
- What steps do they take?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What decisions do they make?
- What information do they seek?

**Example (Signup stage)**:
- Clicks "Start Free Trial"
- Fills out registration form
- Verifies email
- Sets up profile
- Invites team members

### Step 4: Identify Touchpoints (15 min)

Where/how do they interact with you (or competitors)?

**Touchpoint categories**:
- Digital: Website, app, email, chat
- Human: Sales, support, success
- Physical: Store, packaging, hardware
- Third-party: Reviews, social, partners

**Example (Consideration stage)**:
- Pricing page
- Competitor comparison sites
- Product reviews on G2
- LinkedIn posts from users
- Demo video on YouTube

### Step 5: Capture Thoughts and Emotions (20 min)

What are they thinking and feeling at each stage?

**Thoughts** (internal monologue):
- "Is this worth my time?"
- "How does this compare to X?"
- "This is confusing..."
- "Finally, this is what I needed!"

**Emotions** (use a simple scale):
- 😊 Positive / Satisfied / Delighted
- 😐 Neutral / Uncertain
- 😞 Frustrated / Confused / Anxious

**Emotional curve**: Plot the highs and lows across the journey.

```
Emotion
   +  |        *
      |    *       *
   0  |--*-------------*---
      | *               *
   -  |                   *
      └───────────────────────
        Stage 1  2  3  4  5  6
```

### Step 6: Identify Pain Points (15 min)

Where does the experience break down?

**Pain point categories**:
- Friction: Too many steps, slow, complex
- Confusion: Unclear what to do, missing information
- Anxiety: Uncertainty, fear of making mistakes
- Frustration: Things don't work, unmet expectations
- Disappointment: Gap between expectation and reality

**Rate severity**: High / Medium / Low impact on experience

### Step 7: Find Opportunities (15 min)

For each pain point, brainstorm improvements:

| Pain Point | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| Signup form too long | Progressive profiling |
| Unclear pricing | Transparent pricing page |
| No human contact | Add chat option |
| Slow onboarding | Quick-start wizard |

**Prioritize**: Impact vs. Effort matrix

## Workshop Format (2-3 hours)

**Participants**: 4-8 people, cross-functional

3. **Stage brainstorm** (15 min): Identify journey stages
4. **Individual mapping** (30 min): Each person maps actions/touchpoints
5. **Share and consolidate** (30 min): Combine into master map
6. **Emotional mapping** (20 min): Add thoughts and feelings
7. **Pain point identification** (20 min): Find the problems
8. **Opportunity brainstorm** (20 min): Generate solutions
9. **Prioritization** (15 min): Rank opportunities
10. **Next steps** (10 min): Assign owners and actions

## Tips for Better Journey Maps

### Base it on real research
Don't imagine the journey - talk to actual users. Assumptions create fictional maps.

### Include the messy parts
Real journeys aren't linear. Include loops, drop-offs, and workarounds.

### Use real quotes
Actual user words are more powerful than paraphrased thoughts.

### Keep it visible
Journey maps should live on walls, not in files. Make them big and accessible.

### Update regularly
Journeys change as your product evolves. Review quarterly.

## Common Mistakes

- **Inside-out mapping**: Mapping your process, not user's experience
- **Too abstract**: "User feels frustrated" - be specific about why
- **Missing emotions**: Facts without feelings misses half the story
- **Single touchpoint**: Journey maps should cross channels/touchpoints
- **No action**: Beautiful map that doesn't drive decisions
- **Assumption-based**: Mapping what you think happens vs. what actually happens
