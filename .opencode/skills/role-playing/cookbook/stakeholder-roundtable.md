# Stakeholder Roundtable

Role-play as different stakeholders to surface hidden concerns, conflicting interests, and overlooked perspectives. Imagine each stakeholder at the table, advocating for their needs.

## When to Use

- Decision affects multiple groups differently
- Need to anticipate reactions before announcing
- Want to find solutions that work for everyone
- Stakeholders have conflicting interests
- Time: 20-40 minutes

## The Process

### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

List everyone affected by or influencing the decision.

**Common stakeholder categories**:
- Direct users / customers
- Internal teams (engineering, sales, support, etc.)
- Leadership / management
- Partners / vendors
- Regulators / compliance
- Community / public

**Questions to find hidden stakeholders**:
- "Who will be affected by this?"
- "Who could block this?"
- "Who needs to approve this?"
- "Who will have to change their behavior?"
- "Who benefits? Who loses?"

### Step 2: Define Each Stakeholder

For each stakeholder, establish:

| Attribute | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Goals** | What do they want to achieve? |
| **Concerns** | What are they worried about? |
| **Constraints** | What limits them? |
| **Power** | How much influence do they have? |
| **Success metric** | How do they measure good outcomes? |

### Step 3: Run the Roundtable

For each stakeholder, adopt their perspective fully:

**Opening prompt**:
> "Speaking as [stakeholder], what do you think about [topic]?"

**Dig deeper**:
- "What's your biggest concern?"
- "What would make this work for you?"
- "What would make you reject this?"
- "What information do you need?"
- "What would you trade off?"

**Stay in character** - Advocate genuinely for that stakeholder's interests.

### Step 4: Map Conflicts and Alignments

After hearing all perspectives:

**Alignment map**:
| Stakeholder A | Stakeholder B | Relationship |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Engineering | Product | Aligned on X, conflict on Y |
| Users | Sales | Conflict on pricing model |

**Key conflicts to resolve**:
- List the genuine tensions between stakeholders
- Note which conflicts are fundamental vs. resolvable

### Step 5: Find Synthesis

Look for solutions that address multiple stakeholder needs:

- "What would satisfy both X and Y?"
- "What's the minimum viable for each stakeholder?"
- "Where can we sequence to address concerns over time?"
- "What trade-offs are acceptable to which stakeholders?"

## Stakeholder Matrix Template

| Stakeholder | Goals | Concerns | Power | Position |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| [Name] | [What they want] | [What worries them] | H/M/L | Support/Neutral/Oppose |

## Example Session

**Topic**: Switching from monthly to annual billing

**Customer perspective**:
> "I'm worried about committing for a full year. What if my needs change? I want flexibility. If you force annual, I might look elsewhere. But if there's a significant discount, I'd consider it."

**Sales perspective**:
> "Annual contracts give me predictable revenue and reduce churn. I can offer better pricing. But some customers will push back hard - I need tools to handle objections and maybe a monthly option for SMB."

**Finance perspective**:
> "Annual billing improves cash flow and revenue predictability. We can plan better. But we need to handle the accounting complexity of deferred revenue. Also concerned about refund policies."

**Support perspective**:
> "Annual customers have higher expectations. If they're locked in and unhappy, support burden increases. We need better onboarding to prevent issues. Also, billing date confusion is a major ticket driver."

**Synthesis**:
- Offer both options (annual with discount, monthly with premium)
- Improve onboarding for annual customers
- Create clear refund/cancellation policy
- Give sales objection-handling training
- Solve billing date UX issues first

## Tips for Effective Role-Playing

### Commit to the perspective
Don't just list what they'd think - actually argue for it. Get a little uncomfortable advocating for views you don't hold.

### Include difficult stakeholders
The stakeholder you'd rather not think about often has the insight you need.

### Note emotional reactions
"As this stakeholder, I feel frustrated/excited/anxious because..."

### Challenge obvious alignment
Even stakeholders who "should" agree often have subtle conflicts.

## Solo Variation

When working alone:
1. Write each stakeholder's name on a separate page/section
2. Physically move or change position for each perspective
3. Write in first person as that stakeholder
4. Don't skip stakeholders you find annoying
5. Synthesize only after all perspectives are captured

## Common Mistakes

- **Straw-manning** - Making stakeholders' views artificially weak
- **Skipping uncomfortable perspectives** - The CEO, the angry customer, the regulator
- **Rushing to synthesis** - Let tensions exist before resolving
- **Assuming you know** - Even stakeholders you work with daily can surprise you
- **Forgetting power dynamics** - Some stakeholders matter more for decisions
