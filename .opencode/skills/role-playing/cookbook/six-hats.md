# Six Thinking Hats

Examine ideas through six distinct thinking modes. Created by Edward de Bono, this technique separates different types of thinking so each gets full attention.

## When to Use

- Need structured exploration of an idea
- Group keeps mixing emotions with facts
- Want to ensure creative AND critical thinking
- Decision feels stuck or circular
- Time: 30-60 minutes for full cycle

## The Six Hats

### White Hat - Facts & Information
Pure data. What do we know? What don't we know?

**Focus on**:
- Available data and facts
- Information gaps
- How to get missing information
- Trends and numbers

**Questions**:
- "What facts do we have?"
- "What data is missing?"
- "How reliable is this information?"
- "What would we need to verify?"

**Avoid**: Opinions, interpretations, feelings

### Red Hat - Emotions & Intuition
Gut feelings without justification required.

**Focus on**:
- Immediate emotional reactions
- Intuitions and hunches
- Likes and dislikes
- Fears and excitement

**Questions**:
- "What's your gut reaction?"
- "How does this make you feel?"
- "What excites or worries you?"
- "What does your intuition say?"

**Note**: No need to explain or justify. "I don't like it" is valid.

### Black Hat - Critical Judgment
Devil's advocate. What could go wrong?

**Focus on**:
- Risks and dangers
- Weaknesses and flaws
- Why it might not work
- Logical problems

**Questions**:
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What are the weaknesses?"
- "Why might this fail?"
- "What doesn't fit?"

**Avoid**: Being negative about the process itself

### Yellow Hat - Optimism & Benefits
Best-case thinking. What's the value?

**Focus on**:
- Benefits and advantages
- Value and opportunities
- Why it could work
- Best possible outcomes

**Questions**:
- "What are the benefits?"
- "Why is this valuable?"
- "What opportunities does this create?"
- "What's the best case scenario?"

**Note**: Must be logically grounded, not wishful thinking

### Green Hat - Creativity & Alternatives
New ideas. What else is possible?

**Focus on**:
- New ideas and possibilities
- Alternatives and variations
- Creative modifications
- "What if" exploration

**Questions**:
- "What other approaches exist?"
- "How could we modify this?"
- "What if we tried...?"
- "What's a completely different way?"

**Note**: Quantity over quality. No judgment during green hat.

### Blue Hat - Process Control
Meta-thinking. Managing the thinking process itself.

**Focus on**:
- Organizing the thinking
- Summarizing progress
- Deciding next steps
- Ensuring all hats get time

**Questions**:
- "What hat should we use now?"
- "Have we covered all perspectives?"
- "What conclusions are emerging?"
- "What's our next step?"

## Running a Six Hats Session

### Setup
1. State the topic/decision clearly
2. Explain each hat briefly
3. Set time limit per hat (5-10 minutes)
4. Designate someone to track insights

### Sequence Options

**Standard Order** (recommended for new topics):
Blue → White → Green → Yellow → Black → Red → Blue

**Problem-Solving Order**:
Blue → White → Black → Green → Yellow → Red → Blue

**Quick Decision Order**:
White → Yellow → Black → Red

### Facilitation Tips

- **Everyone wears same hat** - No mixing perspectives
- **Timebox strictly** - Move on even if not "done"
- **No hat-mixing** - "That's a black hat thought, save it"
- **Document per hat** - Keep insights organized
- **Return to hats** - It's okay to revisit

## Example Session

**Topic**: Should we open-source our internal tool?

**White Hat** (Facts):
- Tool has 50 internal users
- Similar tools exist (list them)
- Would require documentation effort
- No competitor intelligence concerns

**Red Hat** (Feelings):
- Excited about community building
- Worried about support burden
- Pride in sharing our work
- Anxiety about code quality judgment

**Black Hat** (Risks):
- Support requests could overwhelm team
- Competitors could benefit
- Might expose security issues
- Documentation is currently poor

**Yellow Hat** (Benefits):
- Attracts talent who use the tool
- Community might contribute improvements
- Builds company reputation
- Forces us to improve code quality

**Green Hat** (Alternatives):
- Open-source core, keep extensions private
- Start with "source available" license
- Partner with existing open-source project
- Create a simplified version for public

**Blue Hat** (Synthesis):
- Key tension: support burden vs. reputation benefits
- Need more data on similar open-source projects' experience
- Decision: Pilot with limited release, measure support load

## Common Mistakes

- **Mixing hats** - Jumping between thinking modes
- **Skipping red hat** - Emotions influence everything, better to surface them
- **Black hat dominance** - Some groups over-index on criticism
- **Rushing green hat** - Creativity needs time and safety
- **Forgetting blue hat** - Process management is crucial

## Solo Use

You can use six hats alone:
1. Write the topic at top of page
2. Create six sections
3. Spend 5 minutes per hat
4. Force yourself to stay in mode
5. Synthesize at the end

The discipline of separating thinking modes is valuable even solo.
