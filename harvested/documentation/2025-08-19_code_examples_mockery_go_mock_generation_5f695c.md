mockery provides the ability to easily generate mocks for Golang interfaces using the [stretchr/testify/mock](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock?tab=doc) package. It removes the boilerplate coding required to use mocks.
## Documentation
[](https://github.com/vektra/mockery#documentation)
Documentation is found at our [GitHub Pages site](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/).
## Development
[](https://github.com/vektra/mockery#development)
taskfile.dev is used for build tasks. Initialize all go build tools:
```
go mod download -x

```

You can run any of the steps listed in `Taskfile.yml`:
```
$ task test
task: [test] go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.txt ./...

```
