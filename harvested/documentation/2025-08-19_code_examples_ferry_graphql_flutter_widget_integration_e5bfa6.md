# Using with Flutter
The `ferry_flutter` package provides an [Operation](https://ferrygraphql.com/docs/flutter-operation-widget) Widget for your convenience that makes it easy to use Ferry with Flutter.
## Setup[#](https://ferrygraphql.com/docs/flutter/#setup "Direct link to heading")
To use `ferry_flutter`, we must include it in our `pubspec.yaml`.
Copy
dependencies:
ferry_flutter:#[latest-version]
## Dependency Injection[#](https://ferrygraphql.com/docs/flutter/#dependency-injection "Direct link to heading")
We will need to pass our Ferry client to our `ferry_flutter` Widget. While `ferry_flutter` can be used with any dependency injection library, we recommend using [`get_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it).
