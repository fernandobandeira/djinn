Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.
Works on 3.9+.
## Example API Usage
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#example-api-usage)
A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified as command-line arguments and logs events generated:
```
import time
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEvent, FileSystemEventHandler
from watchdog.observers import Observer

class MyEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
  def on_any_event(self, event: FileSystemEvent) -> None:
    print(event)

event_handler = MyEventHandler()
observer = Observer()
observer.schedule(event_handler, ".", recursive=True)
observer.start()
try:
  while True:
    time.sleep(1)
finally:
  observer.stop()
  observer.join()
```

## Shell Utilities
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#shell-utilities)
Watchdog comes with an _optional_ utility script called `watchmedo`. Please type `watchmedo --help` at the shell prompt to know more about this tool.
Here is how you can log the current directory recursively for events related only to `*.py` and `*.txt` files while ignoring all directory events:
```
watchmedo log \
  --patterns='**/*.py;**/*.txt' \
  --ignore-directories \
  --recursive \
  --verbose \
  .
```

You can use the `shell-command` subcommand to execute shell commands in response to events:
```
watchmedo shell-command \
  --patterns='**/*.py;**/*.txt' \
  --recursive \
  --command='echo "${watch_src_path}"' \
  .
```

Please see the help information for these commands by typing:
```
watchmedo [command] --help
```

### About `watchmedo` Tricks
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#about-watchmedo-tricks)
`watchmedo` can read `tricks.yaml` files and execute tricks within them in response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that subclass `watchdog.tricks.Trick` and are written by plugin authors. Trick classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers don't need.
An example `tricks.yaml` file:
```
tricks:
- watchdog.tricks.LoggerTrick:
  patterns: ["**/*.py", "**/*.js"]
- watchmedo_webtricks.GoogleClosureTrick:
  patterns: ['**/*.js']
  hash_names: true
  mappings_format: json         # json|yaml|python
  mappings_module: app/javascript_mappings
  suffix: .min.js
  compilation_level: advanced      # simple|advanced
  source_directory: app/static/js/
  destination_directory: app/public/js/
  files:
   index-page:
   - app/static/js/vendor/jquery*.js
   - app/static/js/base.js
   - app/static/js/index-page.js
   about-page:
   - app/static/js/vendor/jquery*.js
   - app/static/js/base.js
   - app/static/js/about-page/**/*.js
```

The directory containing the `tricks.yaml` file will be monitored. Each trick class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the `tricks.yaml` file as arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.
## Installation
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#installation)
Install from PyPI using `pip`:
```
$ python -m pip install -U watchdog
# or to install the watchmedo utility:
$ python -m pip install -U 'watchdog[watchmedo]'
```

Install from source:
```
$ python -m pip install -e .
# or to install the watchmedo utility:
$ python -m pip install -e '.[watchmedo]'
```

## Documentation
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#documentation)
You can browse the latest release [documentation](https://python-watchdog.readthedocs.io/) online.
## Contribute
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#contribute)
Fork the [repository](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue ticket at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog/issues). For general help and questions use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-watchdog) with tag python-watchdog.
Create and activate your virtual environment, then:
```
python -m pip install tox
python -m tox [-q] [-e ENV]

```

If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the "Unreleased" section of the [changelog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog/blob/master/changelog.rst).
## Supported Platforms
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#supported-platforms)
  * Linux 2.6 (inotify)
  * macOS (FSEvents, kqueue)
  * FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue)
  * Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports; ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads)
  * OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them periodically; slow and not recommended)


Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs running on your system to be increased to more than the number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way to do that is to edit your `~/.profile` file and add a line similar to:
```
ulimit -n 1024

```

This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested directory of files and directories with a large number of files.
## Free threaded support
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#free-threaded-support)
watchdog has support for being built and run under free-threaded CPython. However, a full thread saftey audit has not been completed, in particular this affects the macOS FSEvents interface.
## About using watchdog with editors like Vim
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#about-using-watchdog-with-editors-like-vim)
Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so. It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace the files you are editing on the disk. This means that if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events for those files will not be triggered by watchdog. You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable this feature.
## About using watchdog with CIFS
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#about-using-watchdog-with-cifs)
When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to use `PollingObserver`, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an appropriate observer like in the example above, do:
```
from watchdog.observers.polling import PollingObserver as Observer

```

## Dependencies
[](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#dependencies)
  1. Python 3.9 or above.
  2. [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html) (only on macOS when installing from sources)
  3. [PyYAML](https://www.pyyaml.org/) (only for `watchmedo`)
