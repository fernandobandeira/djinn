The official Pinecone Python SDK.
## Documentation
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#documentation)
  * [**Conceptual docs and guides**](https://docs.pinecone.io)
  * [**Python Reference Documentation**](https://sdk.pinecone.io/python/index.html)


### Upgrading the SDK
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#upgrading-the-sdk)
Note
The official SDK package was renamed from `pinecone-client` to `pinecone` beginning in version `5.1.0`. Please remove `pinecone-client` from your project dependencies and add `pinecone` instead to get the latest updates.
For notes on changes between major versions, see [Upgrading](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client/blob/main/docs/upgrading.md)
## Prerequisites
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#prerequisites)
  * The Pinecone Python SDK is compatible with Python 3.9 and greater. It has been tested with CPython versions from 3.9 to 3.13.
  * Before you can use the Pinecone SDK, you must sign up for an account and find your API key in the Pinecone console dashboard at <https://app.pinecone.io>.


## Installation
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#installation)
The Pinecone Python SDK is distributed on PyPI using the package name `pinecone`. By default the `pinecone` has a minimal set of dependencies, but you can install some extras to unlock additional functionality.
Available extras:
  * `pinecone[asyncio]` will add a dependency on `aiohttp` and enable usage of `PineconeAsyncio`, the asyncio-enabled version of the client for use with highly asynchronous modern web frameworks such as FastAPI.
  * `pinecone[grpc]` will add dependencies on `grpcio` and related libraries needed to make pinecone data calls such as `upsert` and `query` over [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) for a modest performance improvement. See the guide on [tuning performance](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/performance-tuning).


#### Installing with pip
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#installing-with-pip)
```
# Install the latest version
pip3 install pinecone
# Install the latest version, with optional dependencies
pip3 install "pinecone[asyncio,grpc]"
```

#### Installing with uv
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#installing-with-uv)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a modern package manager that runs 10-100x faster than pip and supports most pip syntax.
```
# Install the latest version
uv add pinecone
# Install the latest version, optional dependencies
uv add "pinecone[asyncio,grpc]"
```

#### Installing with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#installing-with-poetry)
```
# Install the latest version
poetry add pinecone
# Install the latest version, with optional dependencies
poetry add pinecone --extras asyncio --extras grpc
```

# Quickstart
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#quickstart)
## Bringing your own vectors to Pinecone
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#bringing-your-own-vectors-to-pinecone)
```
from pinecone import (
  Pinecone,
  ServerlessSpec,
  CloudProvider,
  AwsRegion,
  VectorType
)
# 1. Instantiate the Pinecone client
pc = Pinecone(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
# 2. Create an index
index_config = pc.create_index(
  name="index-name",
  dimension=1536,
  spec=ServerlessSpec(
    cloud=CloudProvider.AWS,
    region=AwsRegion.US_EAST_1
  ),

# 4. Upsert embeddings
idx.upsert(
  vectors=[
    ("id1", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, ...], {"metadata_key": "value1"}),
    ("id2", [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, ...], {"metadata_key": "value2"}),
  ],
  namespace="example-namespace"
)
# 5. Query your index using an embedding
query_embedding = [...] # list should have length == index dimension
idx.query(
  vector=query_embedding,
  top_k=10,
  include_metadata=True,
  filter={"metadata_key": { "$eq": "value1" }}
)
```

## Bring your own data using Pinecone integrated inference
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#bring-your-own-data-using-pinecone-integrated-inference)
```

### Installing the Pinecone Assistant Python plugin
[](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client#installing-the-pinecone-assistant-python-plugin)
The `pinecone-plugin-assistant` package is now bundled by default when installing `pinecone`. It does not need to be installed separately in order to use Pinecone Assistant.
For more information on Pinecone Assistant, see the [Pinecone Assistant documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/overview).
## More information on usage
