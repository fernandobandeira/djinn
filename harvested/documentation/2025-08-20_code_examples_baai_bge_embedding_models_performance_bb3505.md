If you do not want to finetune the models, you can install the package without the finetune dependency:
```
pip install -U FlagEmbedding

```

If you want to finetune the models, you can install the package with the finetune dependency:
```
pip install -U FlagEmbedding[finetune]

```

### Install from sources:
[](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding#install-from-sources)
Clone the repository and install
```
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.git
cd FlagEmbedding
# If you do not need to finetune the models, you can install the package without the finetune dependency:
pip install .
# If you want to finetune the models, install the package with the finetune dependency:
# pip install .[finetune]

```

For development in editable mode:
```
# If you do not need to finetune the models, you can install the package without the finetune dependency:
pip install -e .
# If you want to finetune the models, install the package with the finetune dependency:
# pip install -e .[finetune]

```

## Quick Start
[](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding#quick-start)
First, load one of the BGE embedding model:
```
from FlagEmbedding import FlagAutoModel
model = FlagAutoModel.from_finetuned('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5',
                   query_instruction_for_retrieval="Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:",
                   use_fp16=True)

```

Then, feed some sentences to the model and get their embeddings:
```
sentences_1 = ["I love NLP", "I love machine learning"]
sentences_2 = ["I love BGE", "I love text retrieval"]
embeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1)
embeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2)

```

Once we get the embeddings, we can compute similarity by inner product:
```
similarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T
print(similarity)

```

For more details, you can refer to [embedder inference](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/inference/embedder), [reranker inference](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/inference/reranker), [embedder finetune](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/finetune/embedder), [reranker fintune](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/finetune/reranker), [evaluation](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/evaluation).
