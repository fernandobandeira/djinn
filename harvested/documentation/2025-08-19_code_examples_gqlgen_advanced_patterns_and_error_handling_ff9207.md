## What is gqlgen?
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#what-is-gqlgen)
[gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) is a Go library for building GraphQL servers without any fuss.
  * **gqlgen is based on a Schema first approach** — You get to Define your API using the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
  * **gqlgen prioritizes Type safety** — You should never see `map[string]interface{}` here.
  * **gqlgen enables Codegen** — We generate the boring bits, so you can focus on building your app quickly.


Still not convinced enough to use **gqlgen**? Compare **gqlgen** with other Go graphql [implementations](https://gqlgen.com/feature-comparison/)
## Quick start
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#quick-start)
  1. [Initialise a new go module](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module)


```
mkdir example
cd example
go mod init example
```

  1. Add `github.com/99designs/gqlgen` to your [project's tools.go](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)


```
printf '//go:build tools\npackage tools\nimport (_ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen"\n _ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/introspection")' | gofmt > tools.go
go mod tidy
```

  1. Initialise gqlgen config and generate models


```
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen init
go mod tidy
```

  1. Start the graphql server


```
go run server.go
```

## Frequently asked questions
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#frequently-asked-questions)
### How do I prevent fetching child objects that might not be used?
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#how-do-i-prevent-fetching-child-objects-that-might-not-be-used)
When you have nested or recursive schema like this:
```
type User {
	id: ID!
	name: String!
	friends: [User!]!
}
```

You need to tell gqlgen that it should only fetch friends if the user requested it. There are two ways to do this:
### Using Custom Models
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#using-custom-models)
Write a custom model that omits the friends field:
```
type User struct {
 ID int
 Name string
}
```

And reference the model in `gqlgen.yml`:
```
# gqlgen.yml
models:
 User:
  model: github.com/you/pkg/model.User # go import path to the User struct above
```

### Using Explicit Resolvers
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#using-explicit-resolvers)
If you want to keep using the generated model, mark the field as requiring a resolver explicitly in `gqlgen.yml` like this:
```
# gqlgen.yml
models:
 User:
  fields:
   friends:
    resolver: true # force a resolver to be generated
```

After doing either of the above and running generate we will need to provide a resolver for friends:
```
func (r *userResolver) Friends(ctx context.Context, obj *User) ([]*User, error) {
 // select * from user where friendid = obj.ID
 return friends, nil
}
```

You can also use inline config with directives to achieve the same result
```
directive @goModel(
	model: String
	models: [String!]
) on OBJECT | INPUT_OBJECT | SCALAR | ENUM | INTERFACE | UNION
directive @goField(
	forceResolver: Boolean
	name: String
	omittable: Boolean
	type: String
) on INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD_DEFINITION
type User @goModel(model: "github.com/you/pkg/model.User") {
	id: ID! @goField(name: "todoId")
	friends: [User!]! @goField(forceResolver: true)
}
```

The field resolvers will be executed concurrently in separate goroutines. The degree of concurrency can be customized with the [`worker_limit` configuration attribute](https://gqlgen.com/config/).
### Can I change the type of the ID from type String to Type Int?
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#can-i-change-the-type-of-the-id-from-type-string-to-type-int)
Yes! You can by remapping it in config as seen below:
```
models:
 ID: # The GraphQL type ID is backed by
  model:
   - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.IntID # a go integer
   - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.ID # or a go string
   - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.UintID # or a go uint
```

This means gqlgen will be able to automatically bind to strings or ints for models you have written yourself, but the first model in this list is used as the default type and it will always be used when:
  * Generating models based on schema
  * As arguments in resolvers


There isn't any way around this, gqlgen has no way to know what you want in a given context.
### Why do my interfaces have getters? Can I disable these?
[](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen#why-do-my-interfaces-have-getters-can-i-disable-these)
These were added in v0.17.14 to allow accessing common interface fields without casting to a concrete type. However, certain fields, like Relay-style Connections, cannot be implemented with simple getters.
If you'd prefer to not have getters generated in your interfaces, you can add the following in your `gqlgen.yml`:
```
# gqlgen.yml
omit_getters: true
```
