**Date Published:** September 2020 (includes updates as of Dec. 10, 2020)
**Supersedes:** [SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (09/23/2020)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/final)
**Planning Note ( 03/20/2025):**
**(3/20/25) Updated the "Control Collaboration Index Template" files (Excel and Word).**
On November 7, 2023, NIST issued a patch release of [SP 800-53 (Release 5.1.1)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_1/home) that includes:
  * minor grammatical edits and clarification;
  * the introduction of “leading zeros” to the control identifiers (e.g., instead of AC-1, the control identifier will be updated to AC-01); and
  * one new control and three supporting control enhancements related to identity providers, authorization servers, the protection of cryptographic keys, the verification of identity assertions and access tokens, and token management.


A list of all the changes in the patch release is [available](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r5-potential-updates.xlsx) under Supplemental Material.

Summary of supplemental files:
  * [**Control Catalog Spreadsheet**](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53r5-control-catalog.xlsx) The entire security and privacy control catalog in spreadsheet format. _Note: For a spreadsheet of control baselines, see the_[ _SP 800-53B details_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53b/final) _._
  * [**Analysis of updates between 800-53 Rev. 5 and Rev. 4**](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53r4-to-r5-comparison-workbook.xlsx) (Updated 1/07/22) Describes the changes to each control and control enhancement, provides a brief summary of the changes, and includes an assessment of the significance of the changes. _Note that this comparison was authored by The MITRE Corporation for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and is being shared with permission by DNI._
  * [**Mapping of Appendix J Privacy Controls (Rev. 4) to Rev. 5**](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53r4-appj-to-r5-comparison.xlsx) Supports organizations using the privacy controls in Appendix J of SP 800-53 Rev. 4 that are transitioning to the integrated control catalog in Rev. 5. 
  * **Mappings and crosswalks between 800-53 Rev. 5 and other frameworks and standards** ([NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/csf-pf-to-sp800-53r5-mappings.xlsx); [**ISO/IEC 27001:2022**](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir/informative-reference-catalog/details?referenceId=155#/)**[updated 12/19/23])** Mappings and crosswalks provide a general indication of SP 800-53 control coverage with respect to other frameworks and standards. When leveraging these relationships, consider the scope and intended use of each publication. Do not assume equivalency based solely on relationship tables; mappings and crosswalks are not always one-to-one and relationship analysis can be subjective.


Also available:
  * **Security and Privacy Control Collaboration Index Template**([Excel](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53-collaboration-index-template.xlsx) & [Word](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53-collaboration-index-template.docx)) The collaboration index template supports information security and privacy program collaboration to help ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met and that risks are appropriately managed. It is an optional tool for information security and privacy programs to identify the degree of collaboration needed between security and privacy programs with respect to the selection and/or implementation of controls in Rev. 5. 
  * [**OSCAL version of 800-53 Rev. 5 controls**](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/tree/master/nist.gov/SP800-53) Rev. 5 controls are provided using the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) (OSCAL); currently available in JSON, XML, and YAML.

#### Abstract
This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.
