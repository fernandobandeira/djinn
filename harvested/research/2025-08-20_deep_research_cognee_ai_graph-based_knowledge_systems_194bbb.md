## Description
Adds a Neptune Analytics 'hybrid' integration layer to the Cognee.ai
memory storage layer. The following configuration will use Amazon
Neptune Analytics to store all nodes, edges, and vector embeddings for
the Cognee.ai memory conversation.
```
  cognee.config.set_graph_db_config\(
    {
      "graph_database_provider": "neptune_analytics", # Specify Neptune Analytics as provider
      "graph_database_url": graph_endpoint_url, # Neptune Analytics endpoint with the format neptune-graph://<GRAPH_ID>
    }
  \)
  cognee.config.set_vector_db_config\(
    {
      "vector_db_provider": "neptune_analytics", # Specify Neptune Analytics as provider
      "vector_db_url": graph_endpoint_url, # Neptune Analytics endpoint with the format neptune-graph://<GRAPH_ID>
    }
  \)
```

- **New Features**
- Enhanced pipeline execution now provides consolidated status feedback
with improved telemetry for start, completion, and error events.
- Automatic generation of unique dataset identifiers offers clearer task
and pipeline run associations.
- **Refactor**
- Task execution has been streamlined with explicit parameter handling
for more structured pipeline processing.
- Interactive examples and demos now return results directly, making
integration and monitoring more accessible.

## 📦 Installation
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#-installation)
You can install Cognee using either **pip** , **poetry** , **uv** or any other python package manager. Cognee supports Python 3.10 to 3.13
### With pip
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#with-pip)
```
pip install cognee
```

## Local Cognee installation
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#local-cognee-installation)
You can install the local Cognee repo using **pip** , **poetry** and **uv**. For local pip installation please make sure your pip version is above version 21.3.
### with UV with all optional dependencies
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#with-uv-with-all-optional-dependencies)
```
uv sync --all-extras
```

## 💻 Basic Usage
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#-basic-usage)
### Setup
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#setup)
```
import os
os.environ["LLM_API_KEY"] = "YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY"

```

You can also set the variables by creating .env file, using our [template.](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee/blob/main/.env.template) To use different LLM providers, for more info check out our [documentation](https://docs.cognee.ai)
### Simple example
[](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee#simple-example)
This script will run the default pipeline:
```
import cognee
import asyncio

async def main():
  # Add text to cognee
  await cognee.add("Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and information retrieval.")
  # Generate the knowledge graph
  await cognee.cognify()
  # Query the knowledge graph
  results = await cognee.search("Tell me about NLP")
  # Display the results
  for result in results:
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  asyncio.run(main())
```

Example output:
```
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary field that involves computer science and information retrieval. It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand and process natural language.
