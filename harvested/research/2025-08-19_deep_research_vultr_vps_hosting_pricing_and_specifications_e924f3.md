##  Kubernetes Engine 
Vultr Kubernetes Engine provides the control plane free of charge. In comparison, the Big Tech clouds typically charge at least $70 per month for the control plane in their managed Kubernetes services. 
When using Vultr Kubernetes Engine, you only pay for underlying worker nodes, as well as associated resources, e.g. Block Storage and Load Balancers. 
##  Databases 
Databases that 'just work' right out of the box. Quickly deploy a new database cluster while letting us manage the configuration, updates, and end-to-end security, so you can stay focused on your app.
###  MySQL

###  FAQ 
Is pricing the same in all data center locations? 
At Vultr, we attempt to keep cloud pricing as consistent as possible globally. However, due to variation in regional costs (such as networking, hardware, labor, taxes, and fees), certain global data center locations may have different per hour and per month pricing for Vultr cloud services. Current data center location pricing is always available in the Control Panel. 
How much does it cost to enable automatic backups? 
An instance with automatic backups enabled will have a 20% higher base monthly/hourly fee. 
Does Vultr charge for stored snapshots? 
Stored snapshots will cost $0.05/GB per month - pricing subject to change. 
How much does DDoS Protection cost? 
DDoS Protection adds 10Gbps of mitigation capacity per instance and costs an additional $10/mo. 
What is the bandwidth overage rate? 
We charge $0.01 per GB for bandwidth used in excess of your quota. 
Does the monthly price include the cost of a Windows license? 
No, Windows licenses are not included in the base price. Plans with a Windows license incur an additional cost that varies based on compute plan selection which can be found [here](https://www.vultr.com/servers/windows).
