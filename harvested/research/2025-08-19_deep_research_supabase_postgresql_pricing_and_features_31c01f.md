#### Choose the best compute size for you
Every project on the Supabase Platform comes with its own dedicated Postgres instance. Select the compute size that fits your needs.
Compute instances are billed hourly and you can scale up or down at any time. Paid Plans come with $10/month in compute credits to cover one Micro instance or offset the cost of any other instance.
Read more on [usage-based billing for compute](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/compute) or [Compute Add-ons](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons).
