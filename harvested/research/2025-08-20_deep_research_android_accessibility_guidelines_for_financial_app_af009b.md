###  Build accessible apps 
Practicing accessible engineering is the right thing to do. It's also required for anyone designing apps for governments or large institutions. Ensure your apps are as accessible as they can be. 
[Start building accessible apps](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps)
![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/picto-icons/earth.svg)
###  Increase your app’s reach 
According to the World Bank, 15% of the world’s population has some type of disability. People with disabilities depend on apps and services that support accessibility to communicate, learn, and work. By making your app accessible, you can reach these users. 
![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/picto-icons/app-quality.svg)
###  Improve your app’s versatility 
Accessibility features benefit all users. For example, if someone is using your app while they cook, they can use voice commands instead of touch gestures to navigate. Low vision features make apps useful in bright sunshine. 
![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/picto-icons/badge.svg)
###  Meet government and institution requirements 
Many countries now require all products used by government employees to be accessible. Companies are following suit. 
[ ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/getting-started.svg) ](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/make-your-android-app-accessible)
###  [ Getting started ](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/make-your-android-app-accessible)
Learn about color contrast, touch target size, content labeling, and other practices that make a big difference to your users. Find out what it means to build accessible apps on Android. 
[Accessibility Pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/make-your-android-app-accessible)
[ ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/design.png) ](https://m3.material.io/foundations/overview/principles)
###  [ Design ](https://m3.material.io/foundations/overview/principles)
Building accessible experiences starts from the beginning. Accessibility in design allows users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your UI.

[ ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/develop.svg) ](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps)
###  [ Develop ](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps)
As you create your app, follow basic accessibility principles that make a big difference to your users, such as succinctly describing each UI element and ensuring all user flows are accessible. 
[Develop Accessible Apps](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps)
[ ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/test.png) ](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing)
###  [ Test ](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing)
Use guidelines, such as Material Design; tools, like the Accessibility Scanner; and automated checks to find ways to improve your app’s accessibility.
