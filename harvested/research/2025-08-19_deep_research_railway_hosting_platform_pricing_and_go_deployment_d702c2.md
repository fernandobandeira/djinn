## Commonly Asked Questions
Which plan is right for me?
  * Hobby is for indie hackers and developers to build and deploy personal projects
  * Pro is for professional developers and their teams shipping to production.
  * Enterprise is for dev teams building and deploying production applications with large instance size, SLA, and/or compliance needs.


How do I get started with the free Trial?
If you do not already have a Railway account, you can sign up for a free Trial by clicking Login on [railway.com](https://railway.com/).
How does the Trial work?
When you sign up for the free Trial, you will receive a one-time grant of $5 in credits that you can use to try out Railway. The credits will be applied towards any usage on the platform and expire in 30 days. If you upgrade to a plan while you still have a credit balance from the trial, the remaining balance will carry over to your new plan.
How does the Hobby plan included usage work?
Your Hobby plan subscription includes $5 of usage per month. If your total usage at the end of your billing period is $5 or less, you will not be charged for usage. If your total usage exceeds $5 in any given billing period, you will be charged the delta.
Does included usage on Hobby accumulate?
Included usage is reset at the end of every billing cycle and does not accumulate over time.
How can I get a receipt?
When you make a payment, you will receive an email with your invoice and receipt attached. You can also find your billing history in [Account -> Billing](https://railway.com/account/billing).
How to add company details on my invoice?
Head to [Account -> Billing](https://railway.com/account/billing) and click ‘Manage Subscription’. From there, you can update your billing information, including billing address and Tax ID.
What payment methods are accepted?
Railway accepts credit cards for plan subscriptions, usage, and to purchase prepaid credits. We support invoice payments for customers on the Enterprise plan.
Can I try Railway without a credit card?
Yes. As a new Railway user, you can sign up for a free Trial. You will receive a one-time grant of $5 to use on resources.
Can I upgrade or downgrade at any time?
You can upgrade any time, and when you do, you will get to the features of your new plan, as well as access to more powerful resources, immediately. When you downgrade, the changes will take effect at the beginning of your next billing cycle.
What happens when I cancel my subscription?
When you cancel your subscription, if you're on Hobby or Pro, your plan will remain active through the end of your current billing period, and any usage will be charged at the end of the period. If you are on the Hobby plan and using prepaid credits as your payment method, your subscription will be canceled immediately and any credit balance you may have will be forfeited.
