## Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need a credit card to get started?
No, you can start using Koyeb without adding a payment method on the Hobby plan. With the Hobby plan, you can run one Web Service and Database for free.
The free Web Service comes with 512MB memory and can be deployed in Europe or US. The free database Service includes 50 hours of usage every month and can be deployed in Europe, US, or Asia.
Is the Starter plan really free?
Yes, the Starter plan is free and includes a free tier composed of one Web Service, one Database services, and 5 custom domains.
The starter plan requires a credit card and additional Services are charged according to your usage, by the second. 
How are processing and bandwidth charged?
Once you've consumed you're monthly free tier, we start billing you on a pay-per-use basis. Processing is accounted per second and billing is rounded up to the nearest unit. We charge you at the end of the calendar month.
How much do additionnal Services cost?
Services are charged depending on the effective usage, starting at $0.000006/second. You define the price you want to pay when you choose the Instance size and the scale. If your app requires a $5.40 Instance and you want to launch 10 Instances, you'll pay $54 per month.
What is outbound bandwidth?
All the data we're sending toward end-users through our CDN and outside of our platform is counted as outbound bandwidth.
We're carefully selecting our cloud service providers to get at $0.04/GB transferred. If you have huge volumes to transfer and this doesn't work, contact us to find solutions.
Can I deploy with my own domain?
Yes! You can use your own domain and we automatically provide SSL. We provide ten custom domain for free and each subsequent domain is $0.20/month.
When can I cancel my subscription?
Whenever you want! Your subscription will end immediately and you will receive a prorated credit for the subscription's unused time.
