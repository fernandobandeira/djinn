[Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html)[AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/financial-services-industry-lens/financial-services-industry-lens.html)
[Design principles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/financial-services-industry-lens/security.html#design-principles)[Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/financial-services-industry-lens/security.html#definitions)
The security pillar focuses on the ability to protect information, systems, and assets through risk assessments and mitigation strategies, while also delivering business value to the organization. In addition to the regulations that apply to any business, financial institutions are challenged with industry- specific requirements such as frequsently-changing regulations and their variation by region. Institutions that operate in more than one country or Region must also meet different requirements in different places. Financial institutions (FI) are historically a frequent target of security incidents, both because of the assets they maintain and their fundamental role in the daily functioning of a modern society. FIs have to comply with rules and laws around the protection of personal and financial information. The continuity of their operations depends directly on the security resilience they put in place. 
## Design principles
In addition to the [design principles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html) found in the security pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the following security design principles can help you improve the security posture of your financial services workloads: 
  * **Security by design** : Financial services institutions must consider a Security by Design (SbD) approach to implement architectures that are pre-tested from a security perspective. SbD helps implement the control objectives, security baselines, security configurations, and audit capabilities for applications running on AWS. Standardized, automated, prescriptive, and repeatable design templates help accelerate the deployment of common use cases as well as help align with security standards across multiple workloads. For example, to protect customer data and mitigate the risk of data disclosure or alteration of sensitive information by unauthorized parties, financial institutions need to employ encryption and carefully manage access to encryption keys. SbD allows you to turn on encryption for data at rest, in transit, and if necessary, at the application level by default. 
  * **Identify regulatory requirements to be implemented** : Regulators expect financial services institutions to define security objectives for workloads, and implement policies that help achieve those objectives. Regulators may also impose their own external requirements on specific workloads and expect institutions to monitor and report on their compliance with these requirements, with penalties for breaching them. Those requirements must be translated into security control objectives that are sustainable over time but flexible to adapt as regulations evolve. 
  * **Automated infrastructure and application deployment:** Automation helps companies to perform and innovate quickly and scale security, compliance, and governance activities across their cloud environments. Financial services institutions that invest in automated infrastructure and application deployment are able to accelerate the rate of deployments and embed security and governance best practices into their software development lifecycle. 
  * **Automated Governance:** Manual governance processes that rely on runbooks and checklists often lead to delays and inaccurate results. Automated governance provides a fast, definitive governance check for application deployments at scale. Governance at scale typically addresses the following components: 
    * **Account management:** Automate account provisioning and maintain good security when hundreds of users and business units are requesting cloud-based resources. 
    * **Budget and cost management:** Enforce and monitor budgets across many accounts, workloads, and users. 
    * **Security and compliance automation:** Manage security, risk, and compliance at scale to keep the organization compliant while achieving business objectives. 


## Definitions
Security in the financial services industry is composed of the following best practice areas. 
  * Security foundations 
  * Identity and access management 
  * Detection 
  * Infrastructure protection 
  * Data protection 
  * Incident response 
  * Application security 


Before you architect any workload, you need to put in place practices that influence security. You should control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.
