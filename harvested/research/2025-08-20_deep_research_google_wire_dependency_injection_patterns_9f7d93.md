Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). Dependencies between components are represented in Wire as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of global variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection, code written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written initialization.
For an overview, see the [introductory blog post](https://blog.golang.org/wire).
## Installing
[](https://github.com/google/wire#installing)
Install Wire by running:
```
go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest
```

and ensuring that `$GOPATH/bin` is added to your `$PATH`.

## Project status
[](https://github.com/google/wire#project-status)
As of version v0.3.0, Wire is _beta_ and is considered feature complete. It works well for the tasks it was designed to perform, and we prefer to keep it as simple as possible.
We'll not be accepting new features at this time, but will gladly accept bug reports and fixes.
## Community
[](https://github.com/google/wire#community)
For questions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/wire/discussions).
This project is covered by the Go [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/google/wire/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
