of Rust compiler, in which hyphens in crate names are converted to
underscores automatically to make the crate names valid Rust
identifiers.

*Summarize the changes made by this PR.*
 - Improvements & Bug fixes
- Added persistent volume in all docker compose files. The advantage is
that by default user's data is not lost when `docker compose down` is
executed unless `--volume` is provided. This gives a default behaviour
that is non-destructive towards user data.

## Chroma Cloud
[](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma#chroma-cloud)
Our hosted service, Chroma Cloud, powers serverless vector and full-text search. It's extremely fast, cost-effective, scalable and painless. Create a DB and try it out in under 30 seconds with $5 of free credits.
[Get started with Chroma Cloud](https://trychroma.com/signup)
## API
[](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma#api)
The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):
```
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()
# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection("all-my-documents")
# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
  documents=["This is document1", "This is document2"], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
  metadatas=[{"source": "notion"}, {"source": "google-docs"}], # filter on these!
  ids=["doc1", "doc2"], # unique for each doc
)
# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
  query_texts=["This is a query document"],
  n_results=2,
  # where={"metadata_field": "is_equal_to_this"}, # optional filter
  # where_document={"$contains":"search_string"} # optional filter
)

## Features
[](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma#features)
  * **Simple** : Fully-typed, fully-tested, fully-documented == happiness
  * **Integrations** : [`🦜️🔗 LangChain`](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-chroma/) (python and js), [`🦙 LlamaIndex`](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1628557389762007040) and more soon
  * **Dev, Test, Prod** : the same API that runs in your python notebook, scales to your cluster
  * **Feature-rich** : Queries, filtering, regex and more
  * **Free & Open Source**: Apache 2.0 Licensed


## Use case: ChatGPT for ______
[](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma#use-case-chatgpt-for-______)
For example, the `"Chat your data"` use case:
  1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
  2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
  3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.


## Embeddings?
[](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma#embeddings)
What are embeddings?
  * [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
  * **Literal** : Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 => `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents "understandable" to a machine learning model.
  * **By analogy** : An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be "near" each other and therefore easy to find.
  * **Technical** : An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
  * **A small example** : If you search your photos for "famous bridge in San Francisco". By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.


Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.
