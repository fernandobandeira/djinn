**PostHog empowers me as an indie dev to create a SaaS business**
**What do you like best about PostHog?**
It has everything I need to get started and more features I can use in future when I'm ready
**What do you dislike about PostHog?**
The interface is very dev-focused which is fine for me, but I can't imagine giving this to a non-tech person in future - but maybe that's just me?
**What problems is PostHog solving and how is that benefiting you?**
I am creating a new product an need early insight into what's working and what's not. This has been crucial for driving engagement and growing my userbase.
**Posthog is a great tool**
**What do you like best about PostHog?**
Posthog is pretty easy to use, and very easy to implement and integrate. We are currently testing it inside our SaaS software. We are not live yet, but I believe it will be really helpful.
**What do you dislike about PostHog?**
The number of features is a bit jarring the first time, it feels like a really heavy tool, and I just heard it's nice and implemented it from there and I was a bit struck at the first time.
**What problems is PostHog solving and how is that benefiting you?**
Posthog is solving the product analytics, to see how users are opening our platform, this is greatly improved by the session replay features
**Finally: product analytics, replays & flags in one fast tool**
**What do you like best about PostHog?**
PostHog replaces a pile of tools and actually speeds up our product loop. We instrumented events in hours, not weeks, and having funnels, retention, and session replay in the same place turns “why?” into clear answers fast. Feature flags and experiments are first-class, so we can ship, test, and roll back safely. The UI is quick, integrations are straightforward, and the docs/community are great. It’s rare to find a platform that product, engineering, and data all love using every day.
**What do you dislike about PostHog?**
Mostly nitpicks: because it does so much, the first week has a small learning curve and navigation can feel dense until you learn where things live. Naming your events well matters, and a few advanced charts take a bit of trial and error. After that brief ramp-up, everything clicks and the power easily outweighs the initial complexity.
**What problems is PostHog solving and how is that benefiting you?**
PostHog fixed our identity chaos. It reliably stitches anonymous sessions to known users after identify events and makes it simple to merge duplicate profiles when the same person shows up with different IDs (e.g., email vs. device/app IDs). That gives us clean, unified customer timelines across web and mobile, so funnels, retention, and cohorting are finally accurate. Support and growth benefit from seeing one truth per user (not three duplicates), and product can target flags/experiments at real cohorts instead of fragmented IDs. We spend less time writing manual SQL to dedupe, session replays follow the same person across devices, and our reporting (activation, conversion, churn) is trustworthy and faster to act on.

### Estimate your price
Event types, explained
Events are billed at different rates based on volume and if you choose to send custom user properties with the event.
### Anonymous events
![Anonymous event example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1/posthog.com/src/components/Pricing/PricingCalculator/Tabs/event-anonymous)
### Anonymous events
No individually-identifiable info, analyzed in aggregate, don't use person profiles
By default, events are anonymous, meaning they don't have any personally-identifiable information attached to them.
They come with info about the browser and device, visitor's location, and any UTM parameters.
#### With anonymous events, you can:
  * See a Google Analytics-style dashboard
  * Access properties like UTMs, location, referrer, page views
  * Create **_aggregate_** insights in **Product analytics**
    * How many times users click an element on a page
    * Group visitors by device type or location
    * Filter to interactions on a specific page
    * Track anonymous users across sessions


Pricing starts at 
**$0.00005** /event
First 1 million events/mo free
### Identified events
![Identified event example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1/posthog.com/src/components/Pricing/PricingCalculator/Tabs/event-identified)
### Identified events
Track usage of specific, logged in users by using [person profiles](https://posthog.com/docs/data/persons).
Identify users by their email address or other unique identifier, and attach custom properties to their person profiles.
#### In addition to anonymous event capabilities, you can:
  * Merge anonymous users with their eventual identified user
    * Like when they sign up for your product or use different devices - enables analyzing the user's path
  * Store custom properties on users
    * Use these properties in cohorts, session replay, experiments, and feature flags
  * Create **_user-specific_** insights in **Product analytics**
    * How many times _specific users_ click an element on a page
    * Group _cohorts of users_ by device type, location, or property
    * Filter to interactions on a specific page _by specific users_

#### How our pricing works
  * Only pay for products you use
  * **Generous free tier for each product (resets monthly)**
  * You can set billing limits per product so you never get a surprise bill
  * We also offer **discounts** for startups and non-profits


#### Estimating usage
  * Not sure what your volume looks like? Add the tracking code to your site and check back in a few days – no credit card required.
  * If something stupid happens and you get an unexpected bill (like if [your side project unexpectedly goes viral](https://posthog.com/side-project-insurance) or you're unhappy), we'll pretty much always refund it!
  * We've also written [this handy guide](https://posthog.com/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) to help!

No, you only pay the fee per captured event in a given month (i.e. you only pay when each event is first received). There are no additional costs or fees.

Data (except recordings, see below) is guaranteed to be retained for 7 years on any paid plan and 1 year on a free plan. After 1 year, data may be moved into cold storage so queries may run more slowly.

Nope. We can, however, offer annual commitments (for example, to maintain pricing) if you need them as part of an enterprise agreement.
