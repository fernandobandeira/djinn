## Why Grafana Cloud is your best observability platform
### The only composable observability platform
Grafana Cloud is the only platform that adapts to your needs, whether you’re just getting started with observability or you already have tools in place.
  * Unify data from more than 100+ external data sources into a single dashboard to gain full stack visibility, track real-time SLI/SLO metrics, and more.
  * Send your local Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, or Datadog metrics to a common backend on Grafana Cloud.
  * Leverage the tightly integrated stack to correlate metrics with logs and traces for actionable insights.


[](https://grafana.com/media/products/cloud/overview/grafana-diagram-cloud-observability-platform.png)
[](https://grafana.com/media/products/cloud/overview/grafana-diagram-cloud-turnkey-integrations.png)
### Turnkey infrastructure integrations
Choose from more than 50 curated infrastructure integrations that include only the metrics and logs you need to monitor, without causing cardinality problems.
  * Out-of-the-box dashboards, metrics, alerts, and logs for Kubernetes and legacy infrastructure.
  * Single agent setup for collecting metrics, logs, and traces.
  * Discover underutilized resources within Kubernetes clusters.


### Cost-efficient observability at massive scale
Keep up with the explosive growth in telemetry data without compromising query speeds, dashboard performance, or your budget. Native multi-tenancy and high availability can support enterprise-level scale, and object storage makes long-term storage reliable and cost-effective.
  * Scale up to 1B active series with Grafana Mimir, our horizontally scalable TSDB.
  * Store more logs using less storage thanks to Grafana Loki’s minimal indexing architecture.
  * Keep rampant metrics growth in check with prebuilt cardinality dashboards.

[](https://grafana.com/media/products/cloud/overview/grafana-diagram-cloud-tco.png)
### Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational overhead
  * Grafana Cloud is available in the top three cloud providers so you can leverage the platform and region of your choice.
  * Automatic software updates, access to new features, and zero downtime for upgrades and bug fixes.
  * Unlimited 365x24x7 customer support.


### Improve reliability with AI
  * Predict future capacity needs and account for seasonal fluctuations with metric forecasts.
  * Detect anomalies in your system with outlier detection, and take early action to prevent further impact.
  * Run automated system checks and resolve issues faster with [Sift investigations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/machine-learning/manage/sift/?pg=prod-cloud&plcmt=features).

[](https://grafana.com/media/products/cloud/overview/grafana-diagram-cloud-administration.png)
### Built-in security and cloud administration
  * Securely query private data with Private Data Source Connect.
  * SSO/SAML/LDAP for user authentication. (Pro and Advanced)
  * Data source permissions plus role-based access control (RBAC) to control who can access what. (Pro and Advanced)

“Grafana Cloud significantly improved my team’s ability to observe and triage the systems we own. We’ve been _**able to greatly decrease fragmentation**_ in observability tooling, and _**achieve consistency**_ in how we monitor and alert on key signals across our systems. Being able to easily triage issues across metrics, logs, and traces has _**helped us improve system performance as well as increase operator confidence**_ when on call.”
Jacob Straszynski
Staff Software Engineer
![Mux logo](https://grafana.com/static/img/logos/logo-mux.svg)
“Grafana Cloud probably _**saves us hundreds of engineering hours a year**_. Our platform engineers don’t have to manage the stack any more, and our product engineers don’t have to work through multiple observability tools, which used to really slow down our response times.”
Ryan Grothouse
VP, Engineering
![ASOS logo](https://grafana.com/media/images/logos/logo-asos.svg)
“[Migrating to Grafana Cloud] meant that we could focus on the observability — getting the best out of the platform — without running it…Grafana Cloud Metrics has also helped the team cut costs. It’s cheaper to store this data in a Prometheus format. _**So by offsetting some logs to metrics and moving that data into Grafana Cloud Metrics, we were able to save a significant amount of money.”**_
Dylan Morley
Lead Principal Engineer
![tomtom logo](https://grafana.com/media/images/logos/logo-tomtom-2022.png)
“It didn’t take much time or effort to bring all these different data sources into a single Grafana dashboard using Grafana Cloud. From problem statement to having our first business dashboard up and running was two weeks. And now, months removed from our launch, _**Grafana Cloud is helping us to track SLAs, reduce MTTR, and foster an observability-centric culture**_.”
Carl Meert
Site Reliability Engineer
![Teletracking logo](https://grafana.com/media/images/logos/logo-teletracking.png)
“Grafana Cloud Metrics and Logs not only give us greater visibility into our services, but serve as key feedback mechanisms for an ever-evolving developer experience. We have also lowered our overhead… _**Thanks to 50% savings on our telemetry bill with Adaptive Metrics, we had room in our budget to fund Grafana IRM**_ and now we spend less time on our incident workflow including reducing our toil on postmortems and incident reports.”
Oren Lion
Director of Software Engineering
