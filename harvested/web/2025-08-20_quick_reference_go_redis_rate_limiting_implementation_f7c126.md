> go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. It offers a straightforward interface for interacting with Redis servers.
## Supported versions
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#supported-versions)
In `go-redis` we are aiming to support the last three releases of Redis. Currently, this means we do support:
  * [Redis 7.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.2/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis Stack 7.2 for modules support
  * [Redis 7.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.4/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis Stack 7.4 for modules support
  * [Redis 8.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis CE 8.0 where modules are included
  * [Redis 8.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.2/00-RELEASENOTES) - using Redis CE 8.2 where modules are included


Although the `go.mod` states it requires at minimum `go 1.18`, our CI is configured to run the tests against all three versions of Redis and latest two versions of Go ([1.23](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.0), [1.24](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.24.0)). We observe that some modules related test may not pass with Redis Stack 7.2 and some commands are changed with Redis CE 8.0. Please do refer to the documentation and the tests if you experience any issues. We do plan to update the go version in the `go.mod` to `go 1.24` in one of the next releases.

## Installation
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#installation)
go-redis supports 2 last Go versions and requires a Go version with [modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support. So make sure to initialize a Go module:
```
go mod init github.com/my/repo
```

Then install go-redis/**v9** :
```
go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v9
```

## Quickstart
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#quickstart)
```
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)
var ctx = context.Background()
func ExampleClient() {
  rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
    Addr:   "localhost:6379",
    Password: "", // no password set
    DB:    0, // use default DB
  })
  err := rdb.Set(ctx, "key", "value", 0).Err()
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  val, err := rdb.Get(ctx, "key").Result()
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("key", val)
  val2, err := rdb.Get(ctx, "key2").Result()
  if err == redis.Nil {
    fmt.Println("key2 does not exist")
  } else if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  } else {
    fmt.Println("key2", val2)
  }
  // Output: key value
  // key2 does not exist
}
```

### Authentication
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#authentication)
The Redis client supports multiple ways to provide authentication credentials, with a clear priority order. Here are the available options:
#### 1. Streaming Credentials Provider (Highest Priority) - Experimental feature
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#1-streaming-credentials-provider-highest-priority---experimental-feature)
The streaming credentials provider allows for dynamic credential updates during the connection lifetime. This is particularly useful for managed identity services and token-based authentication.
```
type StreamingCredentialsProvider interface {
  Subscribe(listener CredentialsListener) (Credentials, UnsubscribeFunc, error)
}
type CredentialsListener interface {
  OnNext(credentials Credentials) // Called when credentials are updated
  OnError(err error)       // Called when an error occurs
}
type Credentials interface {
  BasicAuth() (username string, password string)
  RawCredentials() string
}
```

Example usage:
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr: "localhost:6379",
  StreamingCredentialsProvider: &MyCredentialsProvider{},
})
```

**Note:** The streaming credentials provider can be used with [go-redis-entraid](https://github.com/redis/go-redis-entraid) to enable Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication. This allows for seamless integration with Azure's managed identity services and token-based authentication.
Example with Entra ID:
```
import (
  "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
  "github.com/redis/go-redis-entraid"
)
// Create an Entra ID credentials provider
provider := entraid.NewDefaultAzureIdentityProvider()
// Configure Redis client with Entra ID authentication
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr: "your-redis-server.redis.cache.windows.net:6380",
  StreamingCredentialsProvider: provider,
  TLSConfig: &tls.Config{
    MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
  },
})
```

#### 2. Context-based Credentials Provider
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#2-context-based-credentials-provider)
The context-based provider allows credentials to be determined at the time of each operation, using the context.
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr: "localhost:6379",
  CredentialsProviderContext: func(ctx context.Context) (string, string, error) {
    // Return username, password, and any error
    return "user", "pass", nil
  },
})
```

#### 3. Regular Credentials Provider
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#3-regular-credentials-provider)
A simple function-based provider that returns static credentials.
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr: "localhost:6379",
  CredentialsProvider: func() (string, string) {
    // Return username and password
    return "user", "pass"
  },
})
```

#### 4. Username/Password Fields (Lowest Priority)
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#4-usernamepassword-fields-lowest-priority)
The most basic way to provide credentials is through the `Username` and `Password` fields in the options.
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr:   "localhost:6379",
  Username: "user",
  Password: "pass",
})
```

#### Priority Order
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#priority-order)
The client will use credentials in the following priority order:
  1. Streaming Credentials Provider (if set)
  2. Context-based Credentials Provider (if set)
  3. Regular Credentials Provider (if set)
  4. Username/Password fields (if set)


If none of these are set, the client will attempt to connect without authentication.
### Protocol Version
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#protocol-version)
The client supports both RESP2 and RESP3 protocols. You can specify the protocol version in the options:
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr:   "localhost:6379",
  Password: "", // no password set
  DB:    0, // use default DB
  Protocol: 3, // specify 2 for RESP 2 or 3 for RESP 3
})
```

### Connecting via a redis url
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#connecting-via-a-redis-url)
go-redis also supports connecting via the [redis uri specification](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/tree/master/uri/redis.txt). The example below demonstrates how the connection can easily be configured using a string, adhering to this specification.
```
import (
  "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)
func ExampleClient() *redis.Client {
  url := "redis://user:password@localhost:6379/0?protocol=3"
  opts, err := redis.ParseURL(url)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  return redis.NewClient(opts)
}
```

### Instrument with OpenTelemetry
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#instrument-with-opentelemetry)
```
import (
  "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
  "github.com/redis/go-redis/extra/redisotel/v9"
  "errors"
)
func main() {
  ...
  rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{...})
  if err := errors.Join(redisotel.InstrumentTracing(rdb), redisotel.InstrumentMetrics(rdb)); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
```

### Buffer Size Configuration
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#buffer-size-configuration)
go-redis uses 32KiB read and write buffers by default for optimal performance. For high-throughput applications or large pipelines, you can customize buffer sizes:
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr:      "localhost:6379",
  ReadBufferSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MiB read buffer
  WriteBufferSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MiB write buffer
})
```

### Advanced Configuration
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#advanced-configuration)
go-redis supports extending the client identification phase to allow projects to send their own custom client identification.
#### Default Client Identification
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#default-client-identification)
By default, go-redis automatically sends the client library name and version during the connection process. This feature is available in redis-server as of version 7.2. As a result, the command is "fire and forget", meaning it should fail silently, in the case that the redis server does not support this feature.
#### Disabling Identity Verification
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#disabling-identity-verification)
When connection identity verification is not required or needs to be explicitly disabled, a `DisableIdentity` configuration option exists. Initially there was a typo and the option was named `DisableIndentity` instead of `DisableIdentity`. The misspelled option is marked as Deprecated and will be removed in V10 of this library. Although both options will work at the moment, the correct option is `DisableIdentity`. The deprecated option will be removed in V10 of this library, so please use the correct option name to avoid any issues.
To disable verification, set the `DisableIdentity` option to `true` in the Redis client options:
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr:      "localhost:6379",
  Password:    "",
  DB:       0,
  DisableIdentity: true, // Disable set-info on connect
})
```

#### Unstable RESP3 Structures for RediSearch Commands
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#unstable-resp3-structures-for-redisearch-commands)
When integrating Redis with application functionalities using RESP3, it's important to note that some response structures aren't final yet. This is especially true for more complex structures like search and query results. We recommend using RESP2 when using the search and query capabilities, but we plan to stabilize the RESP3-based API-s in the coming versions. You can find more guidance in the upcoming release notes.
To enable unstable RESP3, set the option in your client configuration:
```
redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
			UnstableResp3: true,
		})
```

**Note:** When UnstableResp3 mode is enabled, it's necessary to use RawResult() and RawVal() to retrieve a raw data. Since, raw response is the only option for unstable search commands Val() and Result() calls wouldn't have any affect on them:
```
res1, err := client.FTSearchWithArgs(ctx, "txt", "foo bar", &redis.FTSearchOptions{}).RawResult()

#### Redis-Search Default Dialect
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#redis-search-default-dialect)
In the Redis-Search module, **the default dialect is 2**. If needed, you can explicitly specify a different dialect using the appropriate configuration in your queries.
**Important** : Be aware that the query dialect may impact the results returned. If needed, you can revert to a different dialect version by passing the desired dialect in the arguments of the command you want to execute. For example:
```
	res2, err := rdb.FTSearchWithArgs(ctx,
		"idx:bicycle",
		"@pickup_zone:[CONTAINS $bike]",
		&redis.FTSearchOptions{
			Params: map[string]interface{}{
				"bike": "POINT(-0.1278 51.5074)",
			},
			DialectVersion: 3,
		},
	).Result()

```

You can find further details in the [query dialect documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/dialects/).
#### Custom buffer sizes
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#custom-buffer-sizes)
Prior to v9.12, the buffer size was the default go value of 4096 bytes. Starting from v9.12, go-redis uses 32KiB read and write buffers by default for optimal performance. For high-throughput applications or large pipelines, you can customize buffer sizes:
```
rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
  Addr:      "localhost:6379",
  ReadBufferSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MiB read buffer
  WriteBufferSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MiB write buffer
})
```

**Important** : If you experience any issues with the default buffer sizes, please try setting them to the go default of 4096 bytes.

## Look and feel
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#look-and-feel)
Some corner cases:
```
// SET key value EX 10 NX
set, err := rdb.SetNX(ctx, "key", "value", 10*time.Second).Result()
// SET key value keepttl NX
set, err := rdb.SetNX(ctx, "key", "value", redis.KeepTTL).Result()
// SORT list LIMIT 0 2 ASC
vals, err := rdb.Sort(ctx, "list", &redis.Sort{Offset: 0, Count: 2, Order: "ASC"}).Result()
// ZRANGEBYSCORE zset -inf +inf WITHSCORES LIMIT 0 2
vals, err := rdb.ZRangeByScoreWithScores(ctx, "zset", &redis.ZRangeBy{
  Min: "-inf",
  Max: "+inf",
  Offset: 0,
  Count: 2,
}).Result()
// ZINTERSTORE out 2 zset1 zset2 WEIGHTS 2 3 AGGREGATE SUM
vals, err := rdb.ZInterStore(ctx, "out", &redis.ZStore{
  Keys: []string{"zset1", "zset2"},
  Weights: []int64{2, 3}
}).Result()
// EVAL "return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}" 1 "key" "hello"
vals, err := rdb.Eval(ctx, "return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}", []string{"key"}, "hello").Result()
// custom command
res, err := rdb.Do(ctx, "set", "key", "value").Result()
```

## Run the test
[](https://github.com/redis/go-redis#run-the-test)
go-redis will start a redis-server and run the test cases.
The paths of redis-server bin file and redis config file are defined in `main_test.go`:
```
var (
	redisServerBin, _ = filepath.Abs(filepath.Join("testdata", "redis", "src", "redis-server"))
	redisServerConf, _ = filepath.Abs(filepath.Join("testdata", "redis", "redis.conf"))
)
```

For local testing, you can change the variables to refer to your local files, or create a soft link to the corresponding folder for redis-server and copy the config file to `testdata/redis/`:
```
ln -s /usr/bin/redis-server ./go-redis/testdata/redis/src
cp ./go-redis/testdata/redis.conf ./go-redis/testdata/redis/
```

Lastly, run:
```
go test
```

Another option is to run your specific tests with an already running redis. The example below, tests against a redis running on port 9999.:
```
REDIS_PORT=9999 go test <your options>
```
