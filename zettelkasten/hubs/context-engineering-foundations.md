# Context Engineering Foundations Hub

## Overview
This hub organizes the foundational concepts and insights about context engineering, capturing the initial understanding and creating pathways for deeper exploration.

## Core Concept Cluster

### Primary Definition
[[20250813-143000-context-engineering-definition]] - Context Engineering as Attention Window Optimization
- **Key Insight**: Context engineering is strategic information optimization within constraints
- **Foundation For**: All context engineering techniques and patterns

### Architectural Framework
[[20250813-143100-atomic-design-metaphor]] - Atomic Design Metaphor for Context Engineering
- **Key Insight**: Component-based thinking applies to context design
- **Enables**: Reusable, composable prompt architectures
- **Connection Strength**: High (familiar from design systems)

### Implementation Strategy
[[20250813-143200-on-demand-loading]] - On-Demand Context Loading Strategy
- **Key Insight**: Load context when needed, not when anticipated
- **Pattern**: Progressive disclosure with feedback loops
- **Connects To**: Lazy loading and just-in-time concepts

### Learning Advantage
[[20250813-143300-prompt-experience-progression]] - Limited Prompting Experience as Learning Advantage
- **Key Insight**: Beginner's mind enables better adoption of advanced patterns
- **Implication**: Can skip basic prompting and go straight to architecture
