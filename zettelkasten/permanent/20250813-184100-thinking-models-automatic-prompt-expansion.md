# "Thinking" Models as Automatic Prompt Expansion Systems

## Core Insight
"Thinking" models may not engage in genuine reasoning but rather perform automatic prompt expansion - generating their own molecular context internally before producing the final response. This represents model-generated constraints rather than engineered constraints, potentially achieving similar probability-shaping effects through self-generated pattern activation.

- Efficiency analysis of external vs. internal constraint generation
- Hybrid approaches combining both constraint types

### Contrasts With
- Traditional understanding of model "thinking" as reasoning
- Clear separation between prompt engineering and model capabilities

## Evidence & Examples
### Concrete Example
When a thinking model "works through" a complex problem, it may be generating internal examples and constraints (molecular context) that shape its probability distributions before producing the final answer.

### Abstract Pattern
Thinking models as automatic context engineers - they generate their own molecular constraints internally rather than requiring external prompt engineering to achieve probability shaping.

### Edge Cases
Model-generated constraints may be less precise or targeted than expertly crafted external constraints, potentially leading to less optimal pattern activation.

## Personal Understanding
### My Interpretation
This suggests thinking models and prompt engineering are two different approaches to the same fundamental challenge: shaping probability distributions to activate optimal response patterns.

### Mental Model
Thinking models as having an internal "prompt expansion engine" that automatically generates molecular context before responding, similar to how a human might think through examples before answering.

### Confidence Level
Medium - this is a novel framework that needs validation through comparison testing and analysis of thinking model internals.

## Open Questions
- How efficient are model-generated constraints vs. engineered constraints?
- Can we combine both approaches for optimal results?
- Do thinking models generate better or worse molecular context than human engineers?
- Can we observe or measure the internal constraint generation process?
- When is each approach more valuable?

## Application Ideas
- A/B test thinking models vs. well-engineered molecular context
- Develop hybrid approaches that provide seed constraints for model expansion
- Analyze thinking model outputs to reverse-engineer constraint patterns
- Create frameworks for choosing between engineered vs. generated constraints
