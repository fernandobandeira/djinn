## Architectural Impact Analysis

### Constraint Architecture Preservation
All enhancements maintain existing constraint architecture principles:
- **Atomic Level**: New constraint validators at foundational level
- **Molecular Level**: New protocols composing atomic constraints
- **Cellular Level**: Enhanced memory systems with persistent constraint patterns
- **Organ Level**: Improved orchestration without coordination overhead

### Cross-Agent Coherence
Enhancements create complementary constraint patterns:
- **Tina's ProblemDecomposer** ↔ **Zettelkasten's ConceptExtractor**: Teaching decomposition informs knowledge capture
- **Tina's Session Coherence** ↔ **Zettelkasten's Relationship Matrix**: Learning context informs connection mapping
- **Tina's KnowledgeSynthesizer** ↔ **Zettelkasten's Synthesis Engine**: Teaching synthesis moments inform knowledge synthesis timing

### Performance Validation
Each enhancement includes constraint-based validation:
- **Effectiveness Constraints**: Measurable improvement in function quality
- **Efficiency Constraints**: No degradation in response time or accuracy
- **Coherence Constraints**: Maintained architectural consistency
- **Integration Constraints**: Enhanced cross-agent coordination without coupling
