# Three Core Cognitive Tool Mechanisms: Programs, Schemas, Recursive Prompting

## Core Insight
Cognitive tools operate through three complementary mechanisms that mirror human cognitive processes: Prompt Programs (structured reasoning patterns like heuristics), Context Schemas (organized information structures like mental schemas), and Recursive Prompting (self-improvement loops like cognitive reflection). Together, these create comprehensive reasoning enhancement systems.

## Context
- **Source**: Context Engineering Chapter 5 - Cognitive Tools framework
- **Date Created**: 2025-08-15
- **Learning Session**: Cognitive Tools Deep Dive
- **Triggered By**: Recognition of three-layer architecture parallel to human cognition

- [[20250815-192200-constraint-application-diagnostic-framework]]: Quality measurement for all three mechanisms

### Leads To
- Protocol shells as practical implementation
- Rita's architecture using all three mechanisms
- Cognitive architecture design patterns

### Contrasts With
- Single-mechanism approaches: Comprehensive vs partial cognitive enhancement
- Static prompting: Dynamic, adaptive vs fixed patterns

## Evidence & Examples
### Concrete Example
**Prompt Programs**: Step-by-step reasoning template with parameters (reusable, transparent, consistent)
**Context Schemas**: JSON-like structures defining analysis request format (standardized, validated, clear)
**Recursive Prompting**: Initial response → self-reflection → improved response (iterative quality enhancement)

### Abstract Pattern
Each mechanism targets a different aspect of reasoning: Programs guide process, Schemas structure information, Recursion enables improvement. Combined, they create robust reasoning systems.

### Edge Cases
- Some tasks may benefit more from one mechanism than others
- Over-application of all three can create excessive overhead
- Domain expertise may reduce need for certain mechanisms

## Personal Understanding
### My Interpretation
These three mechanisms work synergistically - Programs provide the reasoning framework, Schemas ensure information is properly structured, and Recursion enables continuous improvement. Rita successfully implements all three.

### Mental Model
Think of cooking: Programs are the recipe steps (process), Schemas are ingredient organization (structure), Recursion is tasting and adjusting (improvement). All three are needed for excellent results.

### Confidence Level
High - We've successfully implemented all three in Rita with good results, validating the framework.

## Open Questions
- What's the optimal balance between the three mechanisms for different tasks?
- Can the mechanisms be learned automatically from successful interactions?
- How do these mechanisms interact with different model architectures?
- Are there additional cognitive mechanisms we should consider?

## Application Ideas
- Rita enhancement: Optimize balance of all three mechanisms in protocol shells
- Development framework: Use as cognitive tool design checklist
- Quality metrics: Measure effectiveness of each mechanism independently
- Training materials: Teach cognitive tool design using this three-layer model
