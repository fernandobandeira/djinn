# Cognitive Tools as Recipes

## Core Insight
Cognitive tools provide "recipes" that prevent models from cutting corners. They shape HOW the model thinks, not just WHAT it thinks about. This is constraint on process, not content.

## Context
- **Source**: Context Engineering Foundations - Chapter 5: Cognitive Tools
- **Date Created**: 2025-08-15
- **Learning Session**: Cognitive Tools Deep Dive
- **Triggered By**: Recipe metaphor for understanding cognitive tool function

## Connections
### Builds On
- [[20250815-172000-cognitive-tools-optimal-path-constraints]]: Process constraints create better outcomes
- [[20250815-172100-internal-vs-external-tools]]: Internal tools constrain process, not capability

### Related To
- Process vs outcome focus in methodology design
- Procedural knowledge vs declarative knowledge

### Leads To
- Recipe design patterns for cognitive tools
- Process decomposition methodologies

## Evidence & Examples
### Concrete Example
**Bad Recipe**: "Make something delicious" (no process guidance)
**Good Recipe**: "Sauté onions until translucent, add garlic for 30 seconds, deglaze with wine" (specific process steps)

**Cognitive Tool Example**: 
- Bad: "Analyze this problem" 
- Good: "First identify the root cause, then brainstorm solutions, then evaluate feasibility, then recommend top 3 options"

### Abstract Pattern
Recipes codify successful processes into repeatable procedures that prevent improvisation mistakes.

### Edge Cases
Some situations require improvisation beyond any recipe (novel creative challenges, crisis response).

## Personal Understanding
### My Interpretation
The recipe metaphor explains why cognitive tools work - they encode the "cooking process" that experts use intuitively but models need explicitly.

### Mental Model
Cognitive tools = procedure manuals that prevent shortcuts that seem efficient but produce poor results.

### Confidence Level
High - recipe metaphor clearly explains the mechanism and value of process constraints.

## Open Questions
- How do we identify which steps in a reasoning "recipe" are essential vs optional?
- When does following a recipe become more important than understanding the principles?
- How do we design recipes that teach principles rather than just procedures?

## Application Ideas
- Design cognitive tools as explicit "reasoning recipes" with clear steps
- Create libraries of proven reasoning recipes for different problem types
- Build tools that help extract successful reasoning recipes from expert behavior
