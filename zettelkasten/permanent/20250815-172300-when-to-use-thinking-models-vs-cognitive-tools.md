# When to Use Thinking Models vs Cognitive Tools

## Core Insight
Use thinking models when uncertain about constraints, for discovery and exploration. Use cognitive tools when optimal constraints are known, for consistent execution. Strategic pattern: Use thinking models first to discover patterns, then engineer them as cognitive tools for reliable deployment.

### Related To
- Discovery vs deployment phases in AI system development
- Exploration vs exploitation in learning systems

### Leads To
- Hybrid development workflows
- Constraint discovery and optimization processes

## Evidence & Examples
### Concrete Example
**Discovery Phase**: Use thinking models (o1, Claude thinking) to explore how to analyze business requirements
**Deployment Phase**: Convert discovered patterns into cognitive tools ("First identify stakeholders, then map pain points, then prioritize by impact")

**Teacher-Zelda Example**: Thinking models discover effective Socratic patterns, then engineer them as cognitive tools for consistent teaching

### Abstract Pattern
Exploration-to-Exploitation pipeline: Thinking models explore the solution space, cognitive tools exploit discovered optima.

### Edge Cases
Some tasks require continuous discovery (creative writing), others require pure execution (data validation).

## Personal Understanding
### My Interpretation
This creates a natural development lifecycle: thinking models for R&D, cognitive tools for production deployment.

### Mental Model
Thinking models = laboratory, Cognitive tools = factory floor

### Confidence Level
High - aligns with general exploration-exploitation patterns across domains.

## Open Questions
- How do we systematically extract patterns from thinking model outputs to create cognitive tools?
- When does the overhead of engineering cognitive tools exceed the benefits?
- How do we maintain cognitive tool effectiveness as contexts change?

## Application Ideas
- Create pipelines for converting thinking model discoveries into engineered constraints
- Build systems that automatically suggest when to transition from exploration to exploitation
- Design hybrid systems that use thinking models for edge cases and cognitive tools for common patterns
