# VC Questions Reference

Common questions VCs ask, organized by category, with guidance on how to answer.

## Core Principle

**VCs are managing deal funnels.** They're determining if your opportunity deserves 3 minutes, 30 minutes, or more. Your answers should be clear, concise, and demonstrate you've thought deeply about your business.

## Category 1: Fund Fit (Quick Screening)

These questions determine if you even belong in their pipeline.

### "What does your company do?"

**Why they ask**: Tests alignment with fund's thesis and investment parameters.

**How to answer**:
- Single sentence, < 15 words
- [Company] helps [customer] [achieve outcome] by [unique approach]
- Avoid jargon and buzzwords

**Good**: "Stripe makes it easy for developers to accept payments online."
**Bad**: "We're building an AI-powered platform leveraging blockchain to disrupt the..."

### "How much traction do you have?"

**Why they ask**: Evidence of market validation - users, revenue, engagement.

**How to answer**:
- Lead with your strongest metric
- Include growth rate
- Be specific with numbers

**Template**: "[X] [metric] growing [Y]% [timeframe]"

**Good**: "$500K ARR, growing 20% MoM with 95% gross retention"
**Bad**: "We have a lot of interest from potential customers"

### "How much are you raising?"

**Why they ask**: Does your ask match their typical check size and stage?

**How to answer**:
- Specific number (not a range)
- Justify with milestones
- Show you've done the math

**Template**: "$[X]M to achieve [milestone] in [timeframe], which positions us for [next round]"

## Category 2: Return Potential

These questions assess if you can generate fund-returning outcomes.

### "How large is your market?"

**Why they ask**: VCs need billion-dollar outcomes. Per Don Valentine: "It's highly improbable to build a large company in a small market."

**How to answer**:
- Show TAM, SAM, SOM
- Use bottoms-up calculation
- Be credible, not aspirational

**Structure**:
1. TAM: Total market if you had 100% share
2. SAM: Segment you can realistically serve
3. SOM: What you can capture in 3-5 years

**Red flag**: Pulling a trillion-dollar number from a report without methodology.

### "How do you make money?"

**Why they ask**: Unit economics sustainability and scalability.

**How to answer**:
- Clear revenue model
- Price point and customer segment
- Path to high margins

**Template**: "We charge [customer] $[X]/[period] for [value]. Current margins are [Y]% with path to [Z]%."

### "What's your exit strategy?"

**Why they ask**: How do investors get returns? Tests your strategic thinking.

**How to answer**:
- Name 3-5 realistic acquirers
- Explain strategic rationale
- Or IPO path if applicable

**Note**: Don't say "we're not thinking about exit yet" - it shows naivety about VC model.

## Category 3: Execution Risk

These questions assess whether you can actually pull this off.

### "Tell me about the founding team"

**Why they ask**: At early stages, they're betting on people, not products.

**How to answer**:
- Relevant experience for THIS problem
- Complementary skills
- Evidence of resilience

**Structure per founder**:
- Background (1 sentence)
- Why uniquely qualified (1 sentence)

### "What is your competition?"

**Why they ask**: Tests market awareness and differentiation strategy.

**How to answer**:
- Acknowledge ALL alternatives (including "do nothing")
- Explain your unique positioning
- Show you've studied them deeply

**Never say**: "We have no competition" - every problem has alternatives.

**Framework**:
1. Direct competitors (same solution, same customer)
2. Indirect competitors (different solution, same problem)
3. Potential competitors (could enter your market)

### "How does your solution work?"

**Why they ask**: Is adoption easy or does it require behavior change?

**How to answer**:
- Simple explanation (assume non-technical)
- Time to value
- Integration requirements

### "How much revenue will you generate in [2 years]?"

**Why they ask**: Can you reach milestones for next round?

**How to answer**:
- Specific number with assumptions
- Connect to current trajectory
- Show the path, not just the target

## Category 4: Round Size Justification

These validate whether the amount makes sense.

### "How will you spend the funds raised?"

**Why they ask**: Tests strategic thinking about capital allocation.

**How to answer**:
- Percentage allocation by category
- Priority order
- Tie to milestones

**Template**:
- 40% Product (X engineers to build Y)
- 35% Sales (X reps to reach Y customers)
- 15% Marketing (channels to drive X leads)
- 10% Operations (infrastructure, etc.)

### "What is your technical roadmap?"

**Why they ask**: Product vision and engineering burn rate.

**How to answer**:
- Next 12-18 months of development
- Key features and why they matter
- Team size needed

### "What is your next growth milestone?"

**Why they ask**: Do you think in concrete milestones vs. abstract goals?

**How to answer**:
- Specific, measurable target
- Timeframe
- Why it matters for next round

**Good**: "$2M ARR in 18 months, which positions us for Series A"
**Bad**: "Become the market leader"

### "Show me your pipeline"

**How to answer**:
- Named prospects (if possible)

## Category 5: Red Flags (Deal Breakers)

These can kill a deal quickly.

### "What's your motivation for starting this company?"

**Why they ask**: Tests founder commitment and alignment with VC model.
