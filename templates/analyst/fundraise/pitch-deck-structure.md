# Pitch Deck Structure

Reference guide for creating investor pitch decks by funding stage.

## Core Principle

**Clarity over polish.** VCs see hundreds of decks - the ones that stand out have one thing in common: they get to the point fast and explain WHY this matters.

## Sequoia Capital Framework

The gold standard. 10 slides that force disciplined thinking.

### 1. Company Purpose
Define your company in a single declarative sentence. This is harder than it looks. Not features, not benefits - your reason for existing.

**Template**: "[Company] helps [target customer] [achieve outcome] by [unique approach]."

### 2. Problem
- Describe the customer pain point
- How is it currently solved?
- What's broken about current solutions?

**Key**: Make the problem feel urgent and expensive.

### 3. Solution
- Your breakthrough concept
- Why it's 10x better, not 10% better
- Demonstrate deep understanding of the problem

### 4. Why Now?
**Critical slide** - timing decides whether startups succeed or die.

Include:
- Technology shifts enabling this solution
- Regulatory changes creating opportunity
- Behavioral changes in target market
- Why previous attempts failed and what's different now

**Avoid**: Generic "AI makes this possible" - show specific proof.

### 5. Market Potential
- TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**Warning**: Be credible. Don't pull a trillion-dollar number from a report and call it your TAM. Show your math.

### 6. Competition/Alternatives
- Direct competitors
- Indirect alternatives (including "do nothing")
- Your positioning and differentiation

**Format**: 2x2 quadrant with meaningful axes (not just "features" vs "price"). Don't automatically put yourself in the top-right - it looks lazy.

### 7. Business Model
- How you make money
- Unit economics (even if early)
- Path to profitability

**Template**: "We charge [customer segment] [price] for [value]. Current conversion: [X]%."

### 8. Team
- Founder backgrounds
- Why THIS team for THIS problem
- Key hires made/planned

**Focus**: Relevant experience, not impressive titles.

### 9. Financials
- Current metrics (if any)
- Projections (3-5 years)
- Key assumptions

### 10. Vision
- 5-year outcome if everything goes right
- The world you're creating
- Why it matters

## Stage-Specific Guidance

### Seed Deck (10-12 slides)

**Focus**: Vision, team, early validation

| Slide | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Problem/Solution | HIGH | Must be crystal clear |
| Why Now | HIGH | Timing justification crucial |
| Team | HIGH | At seed, you're betting on people |
| Market | MEDIUM | Show big opportunity, exact numbers less critical |
| Traction | MEDIUM | Early signals okay, not required |
| Business Model | MEDIUM | Hypothesis acceptable |
| Financials | LOW | Less scrutinized at seed |

**What VCs expect at Seed**:
- $150K-$500K ARR (or strong usage metrics)
- 6-12 months runway plan
- Clear path to Series A milestones

**Median raise (2025)**: $2.5-3.2M at $14-17M pre-money

### Series A Deck (12-15 slides)

**Focus**: Proven traction, scalable model, clear path to growth

| Slide | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Traction | CRITICAL | Several million ARR expected |
| Unit Economics | CRITICAL | Must show LTV:CAC works |
| Go-to-Market | HIGH | Repeatable customer acquisition |
| Business Model | HIGH | Proven, not hypothetical |
| Market | HIGH | Credible bottoms-up TAM |
| Competition | HIGH | Deep competitive awareness |
| Financials | HIGH | Detailed projections, clear use of funds |
| Team | MEDIUM | Track record matters more than bios |

**What VCs expect at Series A**:
- $1-3M+ ARR (SaaS) or strong growth metrics
- Proven unit economics (LTV:CAC > 3:1)
- Clear path to $100M revenue
- Repeatable sales motion

**Median raise (2025)**: $7.9M at $10-30M valuation

## Slide-by-Slide Best Practices

### Title Slide
- Company name
- One-line description (< 10 words)
- Your name and contact

### Problem Slide
**DO**: Start with the customer, use specific examples
**DON'T**: Lead with your solution, use generic statements

**Good**: "Enterprise sales teams spend 40% of their time on data entry, costing companies $50K/rep/year in lost selling time."

**Bad**: "Businesses need better CRM solutions."

### Solution Slide
**DO**: Show the product, explain the magic
**DON'T**: List features, use jargon

### Traction Slide
**DO**: Show hockey stick growth (if you have it), include cohort data
**DON'T**: Cherry-pick metrics, hide churn

**Include**:
- Revenue or usage metrics (MRR, MAU, etc.)
- Growth rate (MoM or YoY)
- Key customer logos (with permission)
- Retention/engagement data

### Team Slide
**DO**: Highlight relevant experience, show why you'll win
**DON'T**: List every advisor, include headshots only

**Template per founder**:
- Name and role
- One line of relevant background
- Why they're uniquely qualified for this problem

### Ask Slide
**DO**: State the amount, explain use of funds
**DON'T**: Give a range, be vague about allocation

**Format**:
- Amount raising: $X
- Use of funds: X% product, Y% sales, Z% ops
- Milestones this enables

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Too many slides | Dilutes message | Stick to 10-15 core |
| No "Why Now" | Looks like bad timing | Add timing logic |
| Unrealistic TAM | Destroys credibility | Show bottoms-up math |
| "No competitors" | Shows naivety | Every problem has alternatives |
| Feature list | Misses the point | Focus on outcomes |
| Buried ask | Creates confusion | Clear slide at end |

---

## Delivery Tips

1. **Know your deck cold** - Never read from slides
2. **Practice the 2-minute version** - VCs decide quickly
3. **Anticipate questions** - Especially "why now" and "why you"
4. **Lead with story** - Data supports narrative, not vice versa
5. **End with clear ask** - Amount, use, timeline
