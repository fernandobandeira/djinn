Status: Executive Summary
Version: 1.0

## The Vision

Djinn is a **premium personal finance app** that uses AI and gamification to make money management magical. Users must sign up for a **7-day trial** with payment information to access the app - there is no free tier.

## Core Value Proposition

### What Makes Djinn Unique
1. **AI-Powered Receipt OCR**: Shows exactly WHAT users bought, not just where
2. **AI Genie Wishes**: Natural language financial analysis powered by points
3. **Forced Trial Model**: High-quality users who are serious about finances
4. **Privacy-First**: No ads, no data sales - subscription only

## Business Model

### Trial-to-Premium Structure
```
Entry: 7-Day Trial (payment required) → $7.99/month or $59/year
Target: 48.8% conversion rate
LTV/CAC: 5.7x ratio
```

### Why No Free Tier?
- **Higher Conversion**: 48.8% vs 18.2% for opt-in trials (2.68x better)
- **Quality Users**: Payment commitment filters serious users
- **Clean Funnel**: Single conversion path to optimize
- **Better Economics**: No free tier support costs

## Points Economy Integration

### Trial Period (7 Days)
- **500 starter points** to experience AI wishes
- **100 points** per receipt scan
- **AI wishes cost 200-500 points** (limited access)
- Maximum earnings: ~2,500 points
- Creates urgency: "Use points before trial ends!"

### Premium Subscription
- **1,000 points monthly allowance**
- **2x earning rate** (200 points per scan)
- **Unlimited basic AI wishes**
- **Premium wishes** (2,000-5,000 points)
- Maximum monthly: 10,000-15,000 points

### Points Psychology
- **Investment**: Points create switching costs
- **Loss Aversion**: Lose points if don't convert
- **Progression**: See value accumulate during trial
- **Scarcity**: Limited wishes without premium

### Days 2-6: Building Habit

- "You've saved $X already!" messaging

### Day 7: Conversion
