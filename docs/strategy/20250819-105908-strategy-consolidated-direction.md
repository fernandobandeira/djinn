4. **Learning** (2 min): "Categorize 10 transactions" = 75 points
5. **Optimization** (varies): "Cancel 1 unused subscription" = 200 points

**Cooldown System**:
- **Free Users**: Big wishes every 72 hours, unlimited small wishes
- **Premium Users**: Big wishes every 24 hours, unlimited small wishes
