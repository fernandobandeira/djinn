## Trial Conversion Strategy

### 7-Day Trial Optimization

**Day 1: Magic Moment**
- Welcome with 500 points

- Show immediate value from receipt scan
- "Your trial includes 500 points to explore!"

**Day 2-3: Habit Formation**
- Daily scan reminder with point reward
- Unlock second AI wish capability
- Show savings discovered so far

**Day 4-5: Investment Building**
- Accumulated data creates switching cost
- "You've saved $X already!"
- Preview premium features

**Day 6: Urgency Creation**

- Evening: "Your premium features activate tonight"

### Conversion Tactics

**Psychological Triggers:**
1. **Loss Aversion**: "You'll lose access to your 1,247 points"
2. **Investment**: "You've already scanned 23 receipts"
3. **Social Proof**: "4,827 users converted this week"
4. **Scarcity**: "Limited AI wishes without premium"

**Smart Segmentation:**
- High engagement (>5 scans): No discount, emphasize value

- Low (<3 scans): 50% off first 2 months
