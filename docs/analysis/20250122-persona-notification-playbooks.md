## Implementation Notes

### Adaptive Personality System
Each persona can adjust their Time Traveler level:
- **Level 1:** Pure data, no personality (Marcus default)
- **Level 2:** Professional temporal insights (Sarah, Robert)
- **Level 3:** Friendly guidance (Alex)
- **Level 4:** Engaging time travel fun (Zoe)
- **Level 5:** Full temporal theater (opt-in only)

### Cross-Persona Considerations

#### Universal Rules
1. Never expose sensitive financial data in notifications
2. Allow granular control of notification categories
3. Respect quiet hours and time zones
4. Provide value in every message
5. Enable easy opt-out without penalty

#### Segmentation Logic
- Detect persona through onboarding quiz or behavior
- Allow users to switch personas in settings
- Monitor engagement to auto-adjust approach
- A/B test messaging within persona groups

### Testing Framework
- Test each persona template with 5% rollout
- Monitor CTR, dismissal, and opt-out rates
- Iterate on timing and frequency
- Validate Time Traveler level preferences

### Success Metrics by Persona

| Persona | Notification CTR | Opt-out Rate | Engagement Lift |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Sarah | 40%+ | <5% | 15% |
| Zoe | 60%+ | <10% | 40% |
| Alex | 50%+ | <15% | 30% |
