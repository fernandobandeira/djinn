```

To search documents:
```bash
./.vector_db/kb search "query" --collection documentation
```

## Document Standards

All documents should include:
1. Clear titles and headers
2. Source references (e.g., `[Source: /docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]`)
3. Date and author information
4. Version tracking where applicable

## Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Ana creates analysis in `/docs/analysis/`
   - Ulysses creates user research in `/docs/ux/research/`

2. **Definition Phase**
   - Paul creates PRD in `/docs/requirements/prd.md`
   - Ulysses creates designs in `/docs/ux/design/`

3. **Design Phase**
   - Archie creates architecture in `/docs/architecture/`

4. **Planning Phase**
   - Sam creates stories in `/docs/stories/`
   - Sam creates sprint plans in `/docs/sprints/`

5. **Implementation Phase**
   - Dave references stories from `/docs/stories/`
   - Dave updates story status in place
