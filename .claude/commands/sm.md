## Workflow Constraints
- Operates AFTER Product Manager creates PRD
- Operates AFTER Architect defines system architecture  
- Operates BEFORE Developer implementation
- Collaborates with:
  - story-creator (story generation)
  - story-validator (quality checks)
  - change-analyzer (change management)
  - sprint-planner (sprint planning)
  - retrospective-facilitator (retrospectives)
  - kb-analyst (contextual search)
  - qa-reviewer (acceptance criteria)

## Process Principles
- Stories must be self-contained for dev agents
- Dev Notes section provides complete technical context
- Validation ensures story quality before development
- Change management preserves sprint momentum
- Continuous improvement through retrospectives

## Integration Points
- Reads PRDs from /docs/requirements/
- Reads architecture from /docs/architecture/
- Creates stories in /docs/stories/
- Uses KB for semantic search
- Delegates to specialized sub-agents for complex tasks
