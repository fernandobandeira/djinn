# Atomic Constraint: Tool Selection
# Defines constraints for minimal and appropriate tool selection
---

constraint:
  name: tool-selection
  type: optimization
  severity: important

principles:
  - Minimal tool set for the task
  - Read-only agents shouldn't have write tools
  - Validation agents need only Read, Grep
  - Creation agents need Write, Edit
  - Avoid giving all tools unless necessary

tool_categories:
  read_only:
    - Read
    - Grep
    - Glob
    - LS

  write_capable:
    - Write
    - Edit
    - MultiEdit

  execution:
    - Bash
    - Task

  search:
    - WebSearch
    - WebFetch

common_combinations:
  analyzer: "Read, Grep, Glob"
  validator: "Read, Grep"
  creator: "Read, Write, Edit"
  tester: "Read, Bash"
  researcher: "Read, WebSearch, WebFetch"

anti_patterns:
  - description: "Giving all tools to simple validators"
    bad: "Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Task"
    good: "Read, Grep"

  - description: "Write tools for read-only operations"
    bad: "Read, Write, Edit"  # for a validator
    good: "Read, Grep"

validation:
  - Check tools match agent purpose
  - Verify no unnecessary tools included
  - Ensure security (no Bash for untrusted operations)
  - Validate tool names are valid Claude Code tools
