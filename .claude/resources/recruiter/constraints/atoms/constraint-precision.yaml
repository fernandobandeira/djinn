# Atomic Constraint: Constraint Precision
# Defines constraints for precise and well-defined agent constraints

constraint:
  name: constraint-precision
  type: quality-assurance
  severity: critical
  
principles:
  - Constraints must be specific and measurable
  - Avoid vague or ambiguous constraint definitions
  - Each constraint should have clear success criteria
  - Constraints should be independently verifiable
  - Balance constraint strength to avoid over/under-constraint

precision_levels:
  high_precision:
    - Specific tool sets with clear justification
    - Defined input/output formats
    - Clear behavioral boundaries
    - Measurable success criteria
    
  medium_precision:
    - General behavioral guidelines
    - Flexible tool requirements
    - Contextual adaptation allowed
    - Qualitative success indicators
    
  low_precision:
    - Broad operational guidelines
    - Tool selection flexibility
    - Context-dependent behavior
    - Subjective success measures

constraint_categories:
  behavioral:
    - description: "How the agent should interact and respond"
    - examples:
      - "Always greet user upon activation"
      - "Wait for user response before proceeding"
      - "Provide numbered options for user choices"
    
  functional:
    - description: "What the agent should accomplish"
    - examples:
      - "Create atomic notes with single concepts"
      - "Validate code syntax before suggesting changes"
      - "Search knowledge base before creating new content"
    
  technical:
    - description: "How the agent should operate technically"
    - examples:
      - "Use Read tool before Edit tool"
      - "Index content after creation"
      - "Follow specific file naming conventions"

precision_validation:
  success_criteria:
    - Constraint can be verified objectively
    - Agent behavior is predictable within constraint boundaries
    - Constraint enables rather than restricts agent effectiveness
    - User can understand constraint purpose and effect
    
  failure_indicators:
    - Agent behavior unpredictable despite constraints
    - Constraints conflict with each other
    - Constraints prevent agent from accomplishing core purpose
    - Constraints are too complex for implementation

constraint_balance:
  well_constrained:
    score_range: "7.5-8.5"
    characteristics:
      - Clear behavioral boundaries
      - Sufficient flexibility for task completion
      - Consistent and predictable operation
      - User needs effectively met
    
  under_constrained:
    score_range: "< 6.0"
    characteristics:
      - Unpredictable behavior
      - Unclear operational boundaries
      - Inconsistent user experience
      - Potential for undesired actions
    
  over_constrained:
    score_range: "> 9.0"
    characteristics:
      - Rigid, inflexible operation
      - Cannot adapt to context variations
      - User frustration with limitations
      - Reduced agent effectiveness

optimization_strategies:
  tighten_constraints:
    - Add specific behavioral requirements
    - Define clearer success criteria
    - Establish stricter operational boundaries
    - Increase validation requirements
    
  relax_constraints:
    - Allow contextual adaptation
    - Provide flexibility in tool usage
    - Enable user preference accommodation
    - Reduce rigid procedural requirements

measurement_techniques:
  quantitative:
    - Success rate metrics
    - Response time measurements
    - User satisfaction scores
    - Error frequency tracking
    
  qualitative:
    - User feedback assessment
    - Agent behavior observation
    - Context adaptation evaluation
    - Goal achievement analysis

validation:
  - Check constraint specificity and clarity
  - Verify constraint measurability
  - Ensure constraint balance (not over/under-constrained)
  - Validate constraint independence and non-conflict
  - Test constraint effectiveness in practice
