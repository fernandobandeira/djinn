# Molecular Protocol: Constraint Orchestration
# Structured constraint protocol for coordinating atomic constraints into coherent agent architectures

## Protocol Purpose
This molecular protocol orchestrates atomic constraints to achieve systematic coordination of constraint architecture elements, implementing constraint-based orchestration where atomic constraints combine into molecular protocols, which organize into cellular memory, enabling organ-level agent intelligence.

## Constraint Architecture Integration

### Atomic Constraints Applied
- **Constraint Precision**: Ensure precise constraint definition and measurement

- **Tool Selection**: Coordinate tool constraints with behavioral and functional requirements
- **Template Structure**: Maintain architectural consistency across constraint levels
- **File Location**: Organize constraint architecture files for efficient access and maintenance

### Molecular Constraint Orchestration
This protocol coordinates atomic constraints into systematic orchestration that creates coherent, well-balanced agent architectures through strategic constraint combination and validation.

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Atomic Constraint Assessment and Validation
**Atomic Constraints Activated**: Constraint Precision, Template Structure

```markdown
Atomic Assessment Protocol:
- Apply constraint precision: Evaluate individual atomic constraints for clarity and effectiveness
- Use template structure: Ensure atomic constraints follow established architectural patterns
- Assess constraint completeness: Verify all necessary atomic constraints are defined
- Validate constraint independence: Ensure atomic constraints don't conflict or overlap
- Establish constraint hierarchy: Determine priority and relationship between atomic constraints

Atomic Constraint Evaluation Process:
1. **Individual constraint analysis**: Review each atomic constraint for specificity and measurability
2. **Constraint dependency mapping**: Identify relationships and dependencies between constraints
3. **Coverage assessment**: Ensure atomic constraints cover all necessary behavioral and functional requirements
4. **Conflict detection**: Identify potential conflicts or contradictions between constraints
5. **Priority establishment**: Determine constraint hierarchy and resolution order for conflicts

Assessment Quality Standards:
