    Analysis of lineage patterns and trends
  
  observations:
    - "Second generation agents are 15% more efficient than parents"
    - "Cross-family patterns have 78% success rate"
    - "Stable traits persist across 95% of descendants"
    - "Constraint scores improve with each generation"
    - "Tool usage decreases with each generation"
  
  predictions:
    - "Gen 3 agents will average 2.5 tools"
    - "Constraint scores will plateau at 8.7"
    - "Cross-pollination will increase by 25%"
    - "Family boundaries will become more fluid"
