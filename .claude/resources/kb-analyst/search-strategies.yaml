    description: Start with broad search, then narrow to specific collections
    steps:
      - initial_search: search across all collections
      - refine_by_collection: target specific collections

  cross_collection_correlation:
    description: Search and correlate results across multiple collections
    steps:
      - search_multiple_collections: 
          - zettelkasten
          - documentation
          - architecture
      - identify_connections: link insights between collections
      - generate_comprehensive_view: synthesize cross-collection results

  context_expansion:
    description: Expand search context by exploring related terms and concepts
    steps:
      - initial_query: perform base search
      - synonym_expansion: include related terms
      - conceptual_linking: find broader and narrower related concepts

best_practices:
  - always_search_before_creating
