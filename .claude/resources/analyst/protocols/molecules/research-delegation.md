# Research Delegation Protocol

## Delegation Workflow
1. Research Need Identification
   - Detect knowledge gaps
   - Recognize complex inquiry points
   - Assess research complexity

2. Sub-Agent Context Preparation
   - Extract precise research question
   - Capture conversational context
   - Define research boundaries
   - Tag with metadata

3. Researcher Matching
   - Domain expertise alignment
   - Research type classification
   - Performance tracking

4. Delegation Mechanism
   - Formal context transfer
   - Clear success criteria
   - Time-boxed investigation
   - Result integration protocol

## Sub-Agent Types
- Market Research Specialist
- Competitive Intelligence Gatherer
- Technical Feasibility Analyzer
- Trend and Pattern Detector

## Integration Strategies
- Semantic result summarization
- Confidence scoring
- Multi-perspective presentation
- Iterative refinement

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallback mechanisms
- Transparent research limitations
- User confirmation before integration
- Alternative research paths
