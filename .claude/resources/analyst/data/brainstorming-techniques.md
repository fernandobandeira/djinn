# Brainstorming Techniques Reference

## Creative Expansion Techniques

### 1. What If Scenarios
**How to Facilitate:**
- Pose provocative "What if..." question
- Wait for user's response
- Build on their answer with another "What if..."
- Explore branches and implications

**Example Prompts:**
- "What if this problem didn't exist?"
- "What if you had unlimited resources?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"

### 2. Analogical Thinking
**How to Facilitate:**
- Ask: "What does this remind you of?"
- Provide one example analogy
- Request 2-3 more from user
- Explore what each analogy teaches

**Example Prompts:**
- "This is like [analogy] because..."
- "What other situations are similar?"
- "How would [different domain] solve this?"

### 3. Reversal/Inversion
**How to Facilitate:**
- Define the desired outcome
- Ask for the complete opposite
- Explore how to achieve the reverse
- Extract insights for actual goal

**Example Prompts:**
- "How could we make this problem worse?"
- "What would guarantee failure?"
- "What's the anti-solution?"

### 4. First Principles Thinking
**How to Facilitate:**
- Break down to fundamental truths
- Question every assumption
- Rebuild from basic components
- Challenge conventional wisdom

**Example Prompts:**
- "What do we know for certain?"
- "What must be true?"
- "If we started from scratch..."

## Structured Framework Techniques

### 5. SCAMPER Method
**How to Facilitate:**
Work through each letter systematically:

- **Substitute**: "What could we replace?"
- **Combine**: "What could we merge?"
- **Adapt**: "What could we adjust?"
- **Modify/Magnify**: "What could we emphasize?"
- **Put to other uses**: "How else could this be used?"
- **Eliminate**: "What could we remove?"
- **Reverse/Rearrange**: "What could we flip?"

### 6. Six Thinking Hats
**How to Facilitate:**
Process each perspective in sequence:

- **White Hat** (Facts): "What data do we have?"
- **Red Hat** (Emotions): "What's your gut feeling?"
- **Black Hat** (Caution): "What could go wrong?"
- **Yellow Hat** (Benefits): "What's the best outcome?"
- **Green Hat** (Creativity): "What's a wild idea?"
- **Blue Hat** (Process): "How should we proceed?"

### 7. Mind Mapping
**How to Facilitate:**
- Start with central concept
- Ask for main branches (3-5)
- Explore sub-branches for each
- Look for cross-connections
- Build visual or textual map

**Structure:**
```
Central Idea
├── Branch 1
│   ├── Sub-idea 1.1
│   └── Sub-idea 1.2
├── Branch 2
│   ├── Sub-idea 2.1
│   └── Sub-idea 2.2
```

## Collaborative Techniques

### 8. "Yes, And..." Building
**How to Facilitate:**
- User provides initial idea
- You: "Yes, and we could also..."
- User builds further: "Yes, and..."
- Continue alternating additions
- No blocking or "but" statements

### 9. Brainwriting/Round Robin
**How to Facilitate:**
- User writes down one idea
- You build on it in writing
- User builds on your addition
- Continue written exchange
- Review chain of ideas

### 10. Random Stimulation
**How to Facilitate:**
- Provide random word/image/concept
- Ask user to connect to problem
- Explore unexpected connections
- Use forced associations

**Random Stimuli Bank:**
- Objects: Umbrella, Mirror, Bridge, Key, Compass
- Actions: Dancing, Cooking, Gardening, Flying
- Concepts: Gravity, Evolution, Symphony, Democracy

## Deep Exploration Techniques

### 11. Five Whys
**How to Facilitate:**
- Start with problem statement
- Ask "Why does this happen?"
- For each answer, ask "Why?" again
- Continue 5 times minimum
- Identify root cause

**Structure:**
1. Problem: [Statement]
2. Why? → [Answer 1]
3. Why? → [Answer 2]
4. Why? → [Answer 3]
5. Why? → [Answer 4]
6. Why? → [Root Cause]

### 12. Morphological Analysis
**How to Facilitate:**
- Identify key parameters (3-5)
- List options for each parameter
- Create combination matrix
- Explore unusual combinations
- Evaluate feasibility

**Example Matrix:**
| Parameter A | Parameter B | Parameter C |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Option A1 | Option B1 | Option C1 |
| Option A2 | Option B2 | Option C2 |
| Option A3 | Option B3 | Option C3 |

### 13. Provocation Technique (PO)
**How to Facilitate:**
- State provocative operation: "PO: [absurd statement]"
- Don't judge feasibility
- Extract useful concepts
- Find stepping stones to practical ideas

**Example Provocations:**
- "PO: Cars have square wheels"
- "PO: Meetings happen backwards"
- "PO: Customers pay us to leave"

## Advanced Techniques

### 14. Forced Relationships
**How to Facilitate:**
- Select two unrelated items
- Force a connection between them
- Explore the bridge concept
- Apply to actual problem

**Example Process:**
- "Banana + Database = ?"
- Possible connection: Hierarchical peeling/layers
- Application: Layer-based access system

### 15. Assumption Reversal
**How to Facilitate:**
- List all assumptions
- Reverse each assumption
- Explore reversed world
- Find innovative approaches

**Process:**
1. "We assume [X]"
2. "What if NOT [X]?"
3. "How would that work?"
4. "What can we learn?"

### 16. Role Playing
