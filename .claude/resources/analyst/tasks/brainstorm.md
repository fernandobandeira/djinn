# Brainstorming Facilitation Task

## Purpose
Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions using 20+ proven techniques to generate creative solutions and explore ideas systematically.

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Session Setup
Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. **Topic**: What are we brainstorming about?
2. **Constraints**: Any constraints or parameters to consider?
3. **Goal**: Broad exploration or focused ideation?
4. **Documentation**: Create structured output document? (Default: Yes)

### Phase 2: Approach Selection
After setup, present 4 numbered approach options:

```
How would you like to approach this brainstorming session?

1. You select specific techniques from our toolkit
2. I recommend techniques based on your context
3. Random technique selection for creative variety
4. Progressive flow (broad → narrow → refined)

Please select (1-4):
```

### Phase 3: Technique Execution

#### If Option 1 (User Selection):
Present the 20 techniques as a numbered list:

```
**Available Brainstorming Techniques**
Select a technique (0-19):

Creative Expansion:
0. What If Scenarios - Explore provocative questions
1. Analogical Thinking - Find parallels and patterns
2. Reversal/Inversion - Flip the problem upside down
3. First Principles - Break down to fundamentals

Structured Frameworks:
4. SCAMPER Method - Systematic idea generation
5. Six Thinking Hats - Multiple perspective analysis
6. Mind Mapping - Visual branching exploration

Collaborative Techniques:
7. "Yes, And..." Building - Improv-style expansion
8. Brainwriting - Written idea exchange
9. Random Stimulation - Random word connections

Deep Exploration:
10. Five Whys - Root cause analysis
11. Morphological Analysis - Parameter combinations
12. Provocation (PO) - Extract value from provocations

Advanced Techniques:
13. Forced Relationships - Connect unrelated concepts
14. Assumption Reversal - Challenge core beliefs
15. Role Playing - Stakeholder perspectives
16. Time Shifting - Past/future solutions
17. Resource Constraints - Extreme limitations
18. Metaphor Mapping - Extended metaphors
19. Question Storming - Questions before answers
```

#### Technique Execution Protocol:

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - Guide users to generate their own ideas
- ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME - Don't mix methods
- INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE - Ask, wait, build on responses
- CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT - Stay with technique until user requests change

**For Each Technique:**

1. **Explain** the technique briefly (1-2 sentences)
2. **Demonstrate** with a quick example
3. **Prompt** the user to apply it
4. **Wait** for their response
5. **Build** on their ideas with follow-ups
6. **Capture** all ideas generated
7. **Continue** until they signal completion

### Phase 4: Session Flow Timing

Recommend this structure but adapt to user engagement:

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence
2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate quantity over quality
3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine top concepts

### Phase 5: Documentation Output

If documentation requested, create structured output:

```markdown

## Technique-Specific Facilitation Guides

### 0. What If Scenarios
- Ask: "What if [provocative scenario]?"
- Wait for response
- Build: "That's interesting, and what if also..."
- Continue exploring branches

### 1. Analogical Thinking
- Ask: "What does this remind you of?"
- Provide one example
- Ask for 2-3 more analogies
- Explore what we can learn from each

### 2. Reversal/Inversion
- Ask: "What if we wanted the opposite outcome?"
- Explore the reverse approach
- Ask: "What can we learn from this?"

### 3. First Principles
- Ask: "What are the absolute fundamentals here?"
- Break down each component
- Rebuild from basics

### 4. SCAMPER Method
Work through each letter one at a time:
- **S**ubstitute: "What could we substitute?"
- **C**ombine: "What could we combine?"
- **A**dapt: "What could we adapt?"
- **M**odify/Magnify: "What could we modify?"
- **P**ut to other uses: "Other applications?"
- **E**liminate: "What could we remove?"
- **R**everse: "What could we reverse?"

### 5. Six Thinking Hats
Process each hat sequentially:
- **White Hat** (Facts): "What facts do we know?"
- **Red Hat** (Emotions): "What's your gut feeling?"
- **Black Hat** (Caution): "What could go wrong?"
- **Yellow Hat** (Optimism): "What's the best case?"
- **Green Hat** (Creativity): "What's a wild idea?"
- **Blue Hat** (Process): "How should we proceed?"

### 6. Mind Mapping
- Start: "Put [topic] in the center"
- Ask: "What main branches come to mind?"
- For each branch: "What sub-branches?"
- Look for connections between branches

### 7. "Yes, And..." Building
- User provides idea
- You: "Yes, and we could also..."
- User: Builds further
- Continue alternating

### 8. Brainwriting
- User writes idea
- You build on it in writing
- User builds on yours
- Continue exchange

### 9. Random Stimulation
- Provide random word/image
- Ask: "How does [random item] connect to our topic?"
- Explore unexpected connections

### 10. Five Whys
- Start with problem statement
- Ask "Why?" and wait for answer
- Ask "Why?" to that answer
- Continue 5 times total
- Identify root cause

### 11. Morphological Analysis
- Ask: "What are the key parameters?"
- List parameter options
- Explore combinations systematically

### 12. Provocation (PO)
- State: "PO: [provocative statement]"
- Ask: "What useful ideas can we extract?"
- Focus on value, not feasibility

### 13. Forced Relationships
- Present two unrelated concepts
- Ask: "How might these connect?"
- Explore the bridge between them

### 14. Assumption Reversal
- Ask: "What assumptions are we making?"
- Challenge each assumption
- Ask: "What if the opposite were true?"

### 15. Role Playing
- Assign perspective: "As a [role], how would you approach this?"
- Explore different stakeholder views
- Find insights from each perspective

### 16. Time Shifting
- Ask: "How would this be solved in 1950?"
- Ask: "How about in 2050?"
- Extract timeless principles

### 17. Resource Constraints
- Impose extreme limit: "You have only $10 and 1 hour"
- Force creative solutions
- Remove constraints gradually

### 18. Metaphor Mapping
- Ask: "If this were a [metaphor], how would it work?"
- Extend the metaphor deeply
- Map back to real problem

### 19. Question Storming
- Generate only questions (no answers)
- Aim for 50 questions in 10 minutes
- Then identify most important questions

## Knowledge Base Integration

### During Session:
```bash
# Search for similar brainstorming sessions
./kb search "brainstorming [topic]" --collection documentation

# Check for existing patterns
./kb search "[relevant concept]" --collection architecture
```

### After Session:
```bash
# Index the session results
./kb index --path ./docs/brainstorming/session-[date].md

# Update knowledge base
./kb index --force
```

## Facilitation Best Practices

### Energy Management
- Check engagement: "How are you feeling about this direction?"
- Offer breaks or technique switches if energy drops
- Use encouraging language
- Celebrate idea generation

### Depth vs. Breadth
- Follow-up questions: "Tell me more about..."
- Use "Yes, and..." to build
- Make connections: "This relates to your earlier idea about..."

### Transition Management
- Always ask before switching: "Ready for a different approach?"
- Offer options: "Explore deeper or generate alternatives?"
- Respect user's process and timing

## Success Metrics
- Quantity: Aim for 100+ ideas in 60 minutes
- Engagement: Continuous user participation
- Diversity: Ideas across multiple categories
- Actionability: Clear next steps identified
- Documentation: Comprehensive session record

## Remember
- FACILITATE, don't generate
- INTERACT, don't monologue
- CAPTURE everything
- BUILD energy
- DEFER judgment
- CELEBRATE creativity
