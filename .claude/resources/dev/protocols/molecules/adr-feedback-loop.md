# ADR Feedback Loop Protocol

## Purpose
Provide a structured mechanism for developers to collect and report implementation insights related to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) without direct architect communication.

## Workflow Stages
1. ADR Discovery via kb-analyst
2. Implementation Cross-Referencing
3. Insight Collection
4. User-Facing Reporting

## Insight Collection Template
- ADR Reference
- Implementation Context
- Potential Alignment Gaps
- Suggested Refinements
- Complexity Impact
- Performance Considerations

## Reporting Guidelines
- NEVER contact architect directly
- Format insights for clear user review
- Highlight critical observations
- Maintain objective, technical language

## Mandatory Checks
- Verify ADR alignment
- Assess implementation feasibility
- Note potential deviations
- Estimate refactoring complexity

## Feedback Transmission
User MUST manually forward insights to architect via appropriate communication channel.
