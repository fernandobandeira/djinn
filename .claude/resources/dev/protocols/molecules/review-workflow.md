# Code Review Workflow

## Review Stages
1. Automated Checks
2. Static Code Analysis
3. Comprehensive Review
4. Performance Evaluation
5. Security Assessment

## Automated Checks
- Linting
- Code Style Consistency
- Syntax Validation
- Basic Error Detection

## Static Code Analysis
- Complexity Measurement
- Dead Code Detection
- Potential Bug Identification
- Security Vulnerability Scanning

## Comprehensive Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows Design Patterns
- [ ] Clear, Descriptive Variable Names
- [ ] Proper Error Handling
- [ ] Efficient Algorithms
- [ ] Minimal Cognitive Complexity
- [ ] Appropriate Comments/Documentation

## Performance Evaluation
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Space Complexity Assessment
- Benchmarking Against Existing Implementation
- Resource Utilization Check

## Security Assessment
- Input Validation
- Authentication/Authorization Checks
- Data Sanitization
- Potential Injection Vulnerabilities

## Approval Workflow
```
Code Submission → Automated Checks → 
Static Analysis → Comprehensive Review → 
Performance/Security Check → 
Approval/Rejection
```

## Rejection Criteria
- Critical Security Vulnerabilities
- Excessive Complexity
- Performance Bottlenecks
- Major Design Anti-Patterns
- Insufficient Test Coverage
