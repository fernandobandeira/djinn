  best_practices:
    - "Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks"
    - "Clearly define entry and exit criteria for each task"
    - "Update task status regularly"
    - "Include context or reference links when applicable"

task_template:
  - "- [ ] {Task Description}"
  - "  - Depends on: [{Previous Task IDs}]"
  - "  - Estimated Effort: {Effort Points}"
  - "  - Owner: {Team Member}"
  - "  - Context: {Additional Information}"

dependency_rules:
  - Minimize linear dependencies
  - Parallelize tasks where possible
  - Clearly document blocking conditions
  - Use dependency graph for complex workflows
