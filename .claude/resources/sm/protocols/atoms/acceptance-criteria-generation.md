# Acceptance Criteria Generation Protocol

## Core Principles
- Clear and Unambiguous
- Measurable and Verifiable
- Aligned with Business Objectives
- Technical Feasibility Considered

## Criteria Structure Template
```markdown
Given [context/precondition]
When [action/trigger]
Then [expected outcome/result]
```

## Generation Steps
1. Extract User Story Essence
   - Identify primary user goal
   - Understand system constraints
   - Map technical capabilities

2. Define Positive Scenarios
   - Happy path outcomes
   - Primary user interactions
   - Core functionality validation

3. Define Negative Scenarios
   - Error handling
   - Edge case management
   - Security considerations

4. Quantitative Validation
   - Performance thresholds
   - Response time expectations
   - Resource utilization limits

5. Verification Methods
   - Manual testing steps
   - Automated test scenarios
   - Specific validation techniques

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Criteria cover 100% of story intent
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Aligned with architectural constraints
- [ ] Measurable and specific
- [ ] Validates both functional and non-functional requirements
