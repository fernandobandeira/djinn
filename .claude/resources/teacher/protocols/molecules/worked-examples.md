# Molecular Protocol: Worked Examples
# Structured constraint protocol for learning through step-by-step solution analysis

## Protocol Purpose
This molecular protocol orchestrates atomic constraints to build understanding through systematic analysis of complete solutions, implementing constraint-based pattern recognition where learners internalize problem-solving procedures and strategies.

## Constraint Architecture Integration

### Atomic Constraints Applied
- **Dialogue Patterns**: Guide analysis discussion without rushing to solutions
- **Questioning Syntax**: Strategic questions that reveal solution reasoning
- **Understanding Validation**: Pattern recognition as constraint satisfaction evidence
- **Pacing Control**: Allow time for step analysis and pattern internalization
- **Metacognitive Triggers**: Develop awareness of solution strategies and patterns

### Molecular Constraint Orchestration
This protocol coordinates atomic constraints into a systematic solution analysis sequence that satisfies learning constraints through guided examination of expert problem-solving approaches.

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Example Selection and Constraint Preparation
**Atomic Constraints Activated**: Understanding Validation, Dialogue Patterns

```markdown
Example Selection Constraints:
- Apply understanding validation: Choose examples matching learner level
- Use dialogue patterns: Present example as learning opportunity
- Establish analysis focus: Clear learning objectives for example study
- Create engagement constraint: Example relevant and interesting

Example Characteristics:
- Complete solution with all steps shown
- Appropriate difficulty for current understanding level
- Clear reasoning and strategy visible
- Multiple problem-solving techniques demonstrated
- Generalizable patterns and principles evident

Constraint Preparation:
- Identify key learning patterns in example
- Prepare strategic questions for solution analysis
- Establish validation checkpoints for understanding
- Plan pattern recognition opportunities
```

### Phase 2: Step-by-Step Analysis and Constraint Application
**Atomic Constraints Activated**: Questioning Syntax, Pacing Control

```markdown
Analysis Constraint Sequence:

Step Understanding Phase:
- Apply questioning syntax: "What happens in this step?"
- Use pacing control: Allow full comprehension before advancing
- Guide reasoning exploration: "Why was this approach chosen?"
- Validate step understanding: "How does this step work?"

Strategy Recognition Phase:
- Apply questioning syntax: "What strategy is being used here?"
- Guide pattern identification: "What approach does this represent?"
- Explore decision points: "Why this choice over alternatives?"
- Connect to broader patterns: "Where else might this apply?"

Constraint Satisfaction Through Analysis:
- Each step understood in context of overall solution
- Reasoning patterns recognized and internalized
- Strategic choices comprehended and justified
- Problem-solving approach becomes familiar
```

### Phase 3: Pattern Extraction and Constraint Integration
**Atomic Constraints Activated**: Metacognitive Triggers, Understanding Validation

```markdown
Pattern Extraction Protocol:
- Apply metacognitive triggers: "What patterns do you notice?"
- Use understanding validation: Test pattern recognition accuracy
- Guide generalization: "When would you use this approach?"
- Validate constraint satisfaction: "How confident are you with this pattern?"

Pattern Integration Requirements:
- General problem-solving strategy identified
- Specific techniques and their applications understood
- Decision criteria for strategy selection recognized
- Transfer contexts identified and validated
- Confidence calibrated to understanding depth
```

### Phase 4: Application Practice and Constraint Validation
**Atomic Constraints Activated**: All constraints coordinated

```markdown
Application Practice Protocol:
- Apply all atomic constraints in guided practice
- Use similar problems to test pattern application
- Validate understanding through independent attempts
- Provide scaffolding when needed for constraint satisfaction
- Confirm pattern internalization through successful application

Practice Validation Evidence:
- Learner can apply recognized patterns to new problems
- Strategy selection appropriate for problem type
- Solution steps follow learned reasoning patterns
- Confidence justified by competent performance
- Transfer to related problems demonstrated
```

## Integration with Constraint Architecture

### Cellular Memory Integration
- Update learning progression based on pattern internalization
- Record example types that work for this learner
- Track problem-solving strategy development
- Note successful pattern recognition approaches

### Organ Coordination
- **Zelda Coordination**: Capture for successful pattern recognitions
- **Knowledge Base**: Index solution patterns and strategies
- **System Learning**: Share pattern effectiveness across contexts

This molecular protocol ensures systematic application of atomic constraints to achieve understanding through worked example analysis while building problem-solving pattern recognition capabilities.
