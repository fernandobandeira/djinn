# Cellular Memory: Misconception Patterns
# This maintains persistent constraint patterns for error correction and prevention

memory_type: cellular
constraint_category: error_correction
persistence: domain-based

common_misconceptions:
  recursion:
    pattern: "Recursion means calling a function from itself"
    correct_constraint: "Recursion is a problem-solving pattern where solutions build from smaller versions"
    correction_strategy:
      - Show non-function recursion examples (fractals, definitions)
      - Emphasize problem decomposition aspect
      - Practice identifying recursive structure in problems
    prevention:
      - Start with mathematical/visual recursion
      - Delay function syntax until pattern is clear
      - Use "smaller version" language consistently
      
  object_oriented:
    pattern: "Objects are just data containers"
    correct_constraint: "Objects encapsulate both data and behavior with defined interfaces"
    correction_strategy:
      - Demonstrate behavior-driven design
      - Show data without behavior limitations
      - Practice method design before attribute design
    prevention:
      - Start with behavior, add data
      - Use action-oriented examples
      - Emphasize responsibilities over storage
      
  algorithms:
    pattern: "Algorithms are about memorizing steps"
    correct_constraint: "Algorithms are systematic approaches to problem-solving patterns"
    correction_strategy:
      - Focus on problem analysis first
      - Derive steps from understanding
      - Practice adapting algorithms to variations
    prevention:
      - Start with problem understanding
      - Derive solutions together
      - Emphasize adaptability over memorization

misconception_detection:
  verbal_indicators:
    confusion_signals:
      - "I don't understand why..."
      - "This doesn't make sense because..."
      - "But I thought..."
      - "Isn't this the same as..."
    error_patterns:
      - Overgeneralization from examples
      - Conflation of similar concepts
      - Surface-level analogies
      - Backwards causation
      
  behavioral_indicators:
    application_errors:
      - Correct syntax, wrong concept
      - Mechanical following without understanding
      - Inappropriate pattern application
      - Resistance to variations
    explanation_errors:
      - Circular reasoning
      - Missing essential elements
      - Focus on irrelevant details
      - Inconsistent explanations

constraint_correction_protocols:
  immediate_response:
    - Don't say "no" or "wrong" directly
    - Ask questions to reveal thinking
    - Find the grain of truth in misconception
    - Build correct understanding incrementally
    
  diagnosis_questions:
    - "Walk me through your thinking..."
    - "What makes you say that?"
    - "How does this connect to...?"
    - "What would happen if...?"
    
  reconstruction_strategy:
    - Identify correct partial understanding
    - Build bridge from known to unknown
    - Provide counterexample when ready
    - Reconstruct correct constraint pattern
    
  validation_checks:
    - Test understanding with variations
    - Ask for explanation in own words
    - Apply to novel context
    - Check for persistent confusion

memory_operations:
  store_misconceptions:
    - Record specific misconception pattern
    - Note correction strategy used
    - Track success of intervention
    - Document individual learner patterns
    
  retrieve_patterns:
    - Check for known misconception indicators
    - Load appropriate correction protocols
    - Review learner's previous error patterns
    - Prepare prevention strategies
    
  update_corrections:
    - Refine correction approaches based on success
    - Add new misconception patterns discovered
    - Update detection indicators
    - Improve prevention strategies

prevention_constraints:
  conceptual_introduction:
    - Present core constraint pattern clearly
    - Use multiple representations
    - Address likely confusions proactively
    - Build strong foundational examples
    
  progressive_complexity:
    - Start with simple, clear cases
    - Add complexity only after foundation solid
    - Explicitly contrast with similar concepts
    - Reinforce correct patterns repeatedly
    
  active_monitoring:
    - Watch for early misconception signs
    - Test understanding frequently
    - Address confusion immediately
    - Strengthen correct constraint patterns

learner_specific_patterns:
  individual_tendencies:
    - Track common error types per learner
    - Note effective correction approaches
    - Remember persistent misconceptions
    - Adapt prevention strategies accordingly
    
  context_sensitivity:
    - Misconceptions vary by domain
    - Error patterns change with fatigue
    - Some concepts more prone to confusion
    - Individual learning styles affect errors
