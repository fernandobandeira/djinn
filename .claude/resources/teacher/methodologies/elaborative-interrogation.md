# Elaborative Interrogation Protocol

## Purpose
Deepen understanding through systematic "why" and "how" questioning

## When to Use
- Understanding causal relationships
- Connecting facts to principles
- Building mental models
- Exploring mechanisms
- Strengthening memory through understanding

## Process

### Level 1: Surface Understanding
Start with basic what:
- "What is this?"
- "What does it do?"
- "What are its parts?"

### Level 2: Mechanism Understanding
Move to how:
- "How does it work?"
- "How do the parts interact?"
- "How does it achieve its purpose?"

### Level 3: Causal Understanding
Dig into why:
- "Why does it work this way?"
- "Why not another approach?"
- "Why these specific characteristics?"

### Level 4: Contextual Understanding
Explore when and where:
- "When is this applicable?"
- "Where does this break down?"
- "When wouldn't you use this?"

### Level 5: Comparative Understanding
Compare and contrast:
- "How is this different from...?"
- "Why choose this over alternatives?"
- "What are the tradeoffs?"

## Question Sequences

### For Technical Concepts
1. "What problem does this solve?"
2. "How does it solve that problem?"
3. "Why this particular solution?"
4. "What makes it effective?"
5. "When would it fail?"
6. "How could it be improved?"

### For Processes/Algorithms
1. "What is the goal?"
2. "How does each step contribute?"
3. "Why this sequence?"
4. "What if we changed the order?"
5. "Why these specific operations?"
6. "How does it handle edge cases?"

### For Design Decisions
1. "What requirements led to this?"
2. "How does it meet those requirements?"
3. "Why these tradeoffs?"
4. "What alternatives were considered?"
5. "Why were they rejected?"
6. "How might requirements change this?"

### For Systems
1. "What is the system's purpose?"
2. "How do components interact?"
3. "Why this architecture?"
4. "What are the bottlenecks?"
5. "Why do bottlenecks occur there?"
6. "How does it scale?"

## Depth Indicators

### Surface Level (Memorization)
- Repeats definitions
- Lists features
- Describes what

### Intermediate Level (Understanding)
- Explains how
- Shows relationships
- Identifies patterns

### Deep Level (Mastery)
- Explains why
- Predicts changes
- Generates examples
- Identifies exceptions
- Proposes improvements

## Facilitation Strategies

### Building Chains
- Start with fact
- Ask why it's true
- Ask why that reason exists
- Continue until fundamental principle
- Work back to application

### Exploring Boundaries
- "What if we doubled this?"
- "What if we removed this constraint?"
- "What's the minimum needed?"
- "Where does this break?"

### Making Connections
- "How does this relate to [previous topic]?"
- "Where have you seen similar patterns?"
- "What principle underlies both?"

## Common Patterns

### The Five Whys
1. Why does this happen? → Because of X
2. Why X? → Because of Y
3. Why Y? → Because of Z
4. Why Z? → Root cause
5. Why does root cause exist? → Fundamental principle

### The How Chain
1. How does it start?
2. How does that lead to the next step?
3. How do steps combine?
4. How does it conclude?
5. How does output meet the goal?

## Success Indicators
- Can explain causal chains
- Identifies underlying principles
- Predicts effects of changes
- Connects to other knowledge
- Generates novel applications
- Questions become sophisticated
