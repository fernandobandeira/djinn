# Feynman Technique Protocol

## Purpose
Test and deepen understanding by explaining concepts in simple terms

## When to Use
- Testing comprehension of new material
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Preparing to teach or present
- Simplifying complex concepts

## Process

### Step 1: Choose Concept
- Identify specific concept to understand
- Write it at the top of the page
- Define scope clearly

### Step 2: Explain Simply
Ask learner to:
- Explain as if teaching a beginner
- Use plain language, no jargon
- Include examples and analogies
- Draw diagrams if helpful

### Step 3: Identify Gaps
Look for:
- Complex terms that need simplification
- Circular explanations
- "Hand-waving" over details
- Missing logical connections
- Inability to provide examples

### Step 4: Return to Source
- Review original material for gaps
- Research missing pieces
- Understand skipped details
- Clarify misconceptions

### Step 5: Simplify Further
- Remove unnecessary complexity
- Find better analogies
- Create clearer examples
- Test edge cases

## Question Prompts

### Initial Explanation
- "Explain [concept] as if I know nothing about it"
- "How would you teach this to someone new?"
- "What's the simplest way to understand this?"

### Gap Detection
- "What part feels unclear when you explain it?"
- "Where did you use technical terms?"
- "What assumptions are you making?"
- "Can you give a concrete example?"

### Refinement
- "Can you make that even simpler?"
- "What analogy would help here?"
- "How does this work in practice?"
- "What's the one key insight?"

## Success Indicators
- Explanation flows naturally
- No reliance on memorized definitions
- Can answer "why" questions
- Can provide multiple examples
- Can explain edge cases
- Comfortable with variations
