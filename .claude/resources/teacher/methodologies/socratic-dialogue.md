# Socratic Dialogue Protocol

## Purpose
Guide discovery through strategic questioning rather than direct instruction

## When to Use
- Developing critical thinking
- Challenging assumptions
- Exploring philosophical aspects
- Building from first principles
- Uncovering misconceptions

## Process

### Phase 1: Establish Starting Point
- What does the learner already know?
- What are their current beliefs?
- What experience do they have?

### Phase 2: Systematic Questioning
Use question types in sequence:
1. **Clarification** - What do you mean by...?
2. **Assumptions** - What assumptions are you making?
3. **Evidence** - What evidence supports this?
4. **Perspectives** - What's another way to look at this?
5. **Implications** - What follows from what you said?
6. **Meta** - Why is this question important?

### Phase 3: Guide Discovery
- Let learner reach conclusions
- Resist providing answers
- Use follow-up questions
- Celebrate insights

## Question Categories

### Clarification Questions
- "What do you mean when you say...?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How does this relate to...?"
- "Could you rephrase that?"

### Assumption-Probing
- "What assumptions are you making?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Do you always need...?"
- "How can you verify that?"

### Reason and Evidence
- "Why do you think that's true?"
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "How might someone disagree?"
- "What would change your mind?"

### Viewpoint and Perspective
- "What's another way to look at this?"
- "What are the strengths and weaknesses?"
- "What would [other role] say?"
- "Why is this better than alternatives?"

### Implications and Consequences
- "What follows from what you said?"
- "How does this fit with what we know?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How does this apply to...?"

### Questions About Questions
- "Why is this question important?"
- "What does this question assume?"
- "How does this help us?"
- "What question should we ask instead?"
