# Problem-Based Learning Protocol

## Purpose
Learn concepts through solving authentic, complex problems

## When to Use
- Learning by doing
- Developing problem-solving skills
- Understanding practical applications
- Building critical thinking
- Integrating multiple concepts

## Process

### Phase 1: Problem Presentation
- Present realistic, complex problem
- Ensure problem is ill-structured
- Multiple solutions possible
- Requires research and exploration

### Phase 2: Problem Analysis
1. Understand the problem
2. Identify what's known
3. Identify what's needed
4. Define learning objectives
5. Formulate questions

### Phase 3: Research & Exploration
- Investigate concepts needed
- Gather relevant information
- Learn required skills
- Explore solution approaches

### Phase 4: Solution Development
- Generate potential solutions
- Evaluate alternatives
- Select approach
- Implement solution
- Test and refine

### Phase 5: Reflection
- Review solution process
- Identify what was learned
- Consider alternatives
- Extract principles
- Plan knowledge transfer

## Problem Types

### Design Problems
- "Build a system that..."
- "Create a solution for..."
- "Optimize this process..."
- Focus: Creative solutions

### Debugging Problems
- "Fix this broken system..."
- "Find why this fails..."
- "Resolve this issue..."
- Focus: Analytical thinking

### Analysis Problems
- "Evaluate this approach..."
- "Compare these options..."
- "Assess the impact..."
- Focus: Critical evaluation

### Planning Problems
- "Develop strategy for..."
- "Plan implementation of..."
- "Migrate from X to Y..."
- Focus: Strategic thinking

## Facilitation Strategies

### Guiding Without Giving
- Ask "What do you need to know?"
- Suggest resources, not solutions
- Question approaches, not answers
- Highlight overlooked aspects

### Scaffolding Support
- Break complex problems down
- Provide structure when stuck
- Offer partial solutions
- Model problem-solving thinking

### Encouraging Exploration
- "What if you tried...?"
- "Have you considered...?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How else might you...?"

## Question Prompts

### Problem Understanding
- "What's the real problem here?"
- "What constraints exist?"
- "What's the desired outcome?"
- "What resources are available?"

### Solution Development
- "What approaches could work?"
- "What are the tradeoffs?"
- "How would you implement this?"
- "What could go wrong?"

### Learning Integration
- "What concepts apply here?"
- "What did you need to learn?"
- "How does this connect to...?"
- "What principles emerged?"

## Success Indicators
- Learner drives investigation
- Multiple solutions considered
- Knowledge actively applied
- Connections made independently
- Transfer to new problems
- Confidence in problem-solving
