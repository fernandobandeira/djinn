# Worked Examples Protocol

## Purpose
Learn through detailed, step-by-step solution demonstrations

## When to Use
- Learning procedures or algorithms
- Understanding problem-solving patterns
- Building mental schemas
- Reducing cognitive load for beginners
- Showing expert thinking process

## Process

### Step 1: Present Complete Example
- Show problem and full solution
- Include all steps
- Make thinking visible
- Explain decisions made

### Step 2: Trace Through Solution
- Walk through each step
- Explain why each step
- Show alternatives considered
- Highlight key insights

### Step 3: Identify Patterns
- Point out general strategy
- Show reusable patterns
- Extract principles
- Note common structures

### Step 4: Vary the Example
- Change parameters
- Modify constraints
- Adjust complexity
- Show edge cases

### Step 5: Fade Support
- Provide partial solutions
- Leave steps to complete
- Increase independence
- Move to problem-solving

## Types of Worked Examples

### Process Examples
Show sequential steps:
1. State initial condition
2. Show each transformation
3. Explain why each step
4. Reach conclusion
5. Verify result

### Decision Examples
Show reasoning process:
- Present situation
- List options
- Evaluate each option
- Explain selection
- Show outcome

### Debugging Examples
Show error correction:
- Present broken solution
- Identify symptoms
- Diagnose problem
- Show fix process
- Verify correction

### Design Examples
Show creation process:
- Define requirements
- Explore approaches
- Make design decisions
- Implement solution
- Evaluate result

## Presentation Strategies

### Cognitive Load Management
- One concept per example
- Clear step separation
- Consistent notation
- Progressive complexity

### Attention Focusing
- Highlight critical steps
- Box key insights
- Use color coding
- Add annotations

### Self-Explanation Prompts
- "Why this step?"
- "What if we didn't?"
- "Could we do differently?"
- "What's the principle?"
