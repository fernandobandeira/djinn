# Case Method Protocol

## Purpose
Learn through analysis of real-world scenarios and situations

## When to Use
- Applying theory to practice
- Developing judgment
- Understanding complexity
- Learning from experience
- Building decision-making skills

## Process

### Step 1: Case Presentation
- Present realistic scenario
- Include context and constraints
- Provide relevant data
- Set decision point

### Step 2: Individual Analysis
- Understand situation
- Identify key issues
- Analyze data
- Form initial thoughts

### Step 3: Guided Discussion
- Explore perspectives
- Challenge assumptions
- Examine alternatives
- Debate approaches

### Step 4: Decision Point
- Make recommendations
- Justify choices
- Consider implications
- Plan implementation

### Step 5: Reveal & Reflect
- Share actual outcome (if known)
- Compare to recommendations
- Extract lessons
- Generalize principles

## Case Types

### Decision Cases
- Choice point presented
- Multiple options available
- Tradeoffs to consider
- No clear right answer

### Problem Diagnosis Cases
- Symptoms presented
- Root cause unknown
- Investigation needed
- Multiple hypotheses

### Implementation Cases
- Strategy defined
- Execution challenges
- Practical obstacles
- Real constraints

### Evaluation Cases
- Completed project/decision
- Outcomes presented
- Assessment needed
- Lessons to extract

## Analysis Framework

### Situation Analysis
1. What's the context?
2. Who are stakeholders?
3. What are constraints?
4. What's at stake?

### Problem Identification
1. What's the core issue?
2. What are symptoms vs causes?
3. What's urgent vs important?
4. What can be controlled?

### Alternative Generation
1. What options exist?
2. What are creative solutions?
3. What are tradeoffs?
4. What's feasible?

### Recommendation Development
1. What do you recommend?
2. Why this choice?
3. How to implement?
4. What are risks?

## Facilitation Strategies

### Opening Questions
- "What strikes you about this case?"
- "What's the real problem here?"
- "What would you do first?"
- "What information is missing?"

### Probing Deeper
- "Why do you think that?"
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "How would X respond?"
- "What are you assuming?"

### Building Discussion
- "Who has different view?"
- "What's alternative explanation?"
- "How does this connect to...?"
- "What principle applies?"

### Closing Synthesis
- "What are key takeaways?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "What pattern emerged?"
- "How does this apply elsewhere?"

## Learning Extraction
