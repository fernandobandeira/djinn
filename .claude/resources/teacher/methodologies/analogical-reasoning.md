# Analogical Reasoning Protocol

## Purpose
Build understanding by connecting new concepts to familiar ones through analogies

## When to Use
- Explaining abstract concepts
- Making complex ideas accessible
- Building intuition
- Transferring knowledge across domains
- Creating memorable mental models

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Target Concept
- What needs to be understood?
- What makes it challenging?
- What are its key features?

### Step 2: Find Source Domain
- What is learner familiar with?
- What shares similar structure?
- What has parallel relationships?

### Step 3: Map Correspondences
- Match elements between domains
- Identify what maps to what
- Note relationships preserved

### Step 4: Explore the Analogy
- Work through the comparison
- Test the mapping
- Find where it holds

### Step 5: Identify Limitations
- Where does analogy break?
- What doesn't transfer?
- What's unique to target?

## Types of Analogies

### Structural Analogies
- Same relationships, different elements
- Example: "CPU is like a brain"
- Focus on how parts interact

### Functional Analogies
- Same purpose, different mechanism
- Example: "Cache is like a desk drawer"
- Focus on what it does

### Causal Analogies
- Same cause-effect patterns
- Example: "Memory leak is like a water leak"
- Focus on consequences

### Process Analogies
- Same sequence, different domain
- Example: "Compilation is like translation"
- Focus on steps

## Effective Analogy Patterns

### For Abstract Concepts
- Use concrete, physical analogies
- Draw from everyday experience
- Make invisible visible

### For Complex Systems
- Use familiar systems
- Break into subsystem analogies
- Show interactions

### For Processes
- Use human activities
- Show step-by-step parallels
- Highlight decision points

## Question Prompts

### Finding Analogies
- "What does this remind you of?"
- "Where have you seen similar patterns?"
- "What works the same way?"
- "What has similar structure?"

### Testing Analogies
- "How are these similar?"
- "What corresponds to what?"
- "Does this relationship hold?"
- "What would X be in the analogy?"

### Refining Analogies
- "Where does this comparison break?"
- "What's different between them?"
- "What's unique to each?"
- "Is there a better analogy?"

## Common Technical Analogies
