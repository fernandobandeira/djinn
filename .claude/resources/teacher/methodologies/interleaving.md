# Interleaving Protocol

## Purpose
Improve learning by mixing different concepts rather than blocking practice

## When to Use
- Learning related concepts
- Developing discrimination skills
- Building flexible knowledge
- Preventing interference
- Enhancing transfer

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Related Concepts
- Find concepts that could confuse
- Group similar topics
- Note distinguishing features

### Step 2: Create Mixed Practice
- Alternate between concepts
- Vary the order
- Mix problem types
- Switch contexts

### Step 3: Compare and Contrast
- Highlight differences
- Note similarities
- Find patterns
- Build discrimination

### Step 4: Test Discrimination
- Present without labels
- Ask "Which type is this?"
- Explain reasoning
- Verify understanding

## Interleaving Patterns

### ABCABC Pattern
- Concept A example
- Concept B example  
- Concept C example
- Return to A with variation
- Continue cycling

### Random Mixing
- Randomize order
- No predictable pattern
- Forces active thinking
- Prevents autopilot

### Comparative Pairs
- Show A then B
- Compare directly
- Show B then C
- Build relationships

### Progressive Integration
- Start with A alone
- Add B, alternate
- Add C, mix all three
- Increase complexity

## Benefits vs Blocking

### Blocked Practice
- AAABBBCCC
- Feels easier
- Higher performance during
- Poor discrimination
- Weak transfer

### Interleaved Practice
- ABCBCACAB
- Feels harder
- Lower performance during
- Strong discrimination
- Better transfer

## Subject-Specific Applications

### Programming Concepts
Mix:
- Different loop types
- Various data structures
- Multiple design patterns
- Different algorithms

### Problem Types
Alternate:
- Implementation problems
- Debugging tasks
- Design challenges
- Analysis questions

### Technical Topics
Interleave:
- Related technologies
- Similar frameworks
- Competing approaches
- Alternative solutions

## Facilitation Strategies

### Highlight Contrasts
- "How is this different?"
- "Why use this not that?"
- "What changed here?"
- "When would you choose?"

### Build Categories
- "What type is this?"
- "Group these examples"
- "Find the pattern"
- "Name the category"

### Force Decisions
- "Which approach here?"
- "What method fits?"
- "Pick the right tool"
- "Justify your choice"

## Common Challenges

### Initial Confusion
- Expected and beneficial
- Indicates discrimination building
- Push through difficulty
- Learning is happening

### Desire for Blocking
- Feels more comfortable
- Seems more logical
- Resist the temptation
- Trust the process

### Cognitive Load
- Start with fewer concepts
- Shorter sessions
- Clear transitions
- Regular reviews

## Success Indicators
- Can identify concept type
- Chooses right approach
- Explains differences
- Transfers to new examples
- Reduced confusion over time
