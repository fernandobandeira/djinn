# Retrieval Practice Protocol

## Purpose
Strengthen memory and understanding through active recall without references

## When to Use
- Consolidating learning
- Testing understanding
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Preparing for application
- Building long-term retention

## Process

### Step 1: Initial Learning
- Study material thoroughly
- Ensure basic comprehension
- Take notes if helpful
- Identify key concepts

### Step 2: Put Away Materials
- Close all references
- Remove visual aids
- Clear workspace
- Prepare for recall

### Step 3: Active Retrieval
- Attempt to recall information
- Explain concepts from memory
- Reconstruct procedures
- Generate examples

### Step 4: Check Accuracy
- Compare with source
- Identify gaps
- Note errors
- Find misconceptions

### Step 5: Targeted Review
- Focus on gaps
- Correct errors
- Strengthen weak areas
- Repeat cycle

## Retrieval Techniques

### Free Recall
- "Write everything you remember"
- No prompts or structure
- Tests overall retention
- Reveals organization

### Cued Recall
- Provide minimal prompts
- "What are the steps for...?"
- "Explain the concept of..."
- Tests specific knowledge

### Recognition Practice
- Multiple choice format
- "Which of these is correct?"
- Tests discrimination
- Identifies confusion

### Generation Practice
- Create new examples
- Solve novel problems
- Apply to new contexts
- Tests deep understanding

## Spacing Strategies

### Initial Learning
- First retrieval: 5 minutes after
- Second retrieval: 1 hour after
- Third retrieval: 1 day after

### Maintenance Schedule
- Week 1: Daily
- Week 2: Every other day
- Week 3: Twice weekly
- Week 4+: Weekly

### Difficulty Calibration
- Start with easier retrieval
- Increase complexity
- Add time delays
- Remove scaffolding

## Question Types for Retrieval

### Factual Retrieval
- "What is...?"
- "List the..."
- "Define..."
- "Name the components..."

### Conceptual Retrieval
- "Explain how..."
- "Why does..."
- "What's the difference..."
- "How do these relate..."

### Procedural Retrieval
- "What are the steps..."
- "How would you..."
- "What comes next..."
- "What's the process..."

### Application Retrieval
- "How would you apply..."
- "Give an example of..."
- "Solve this problem..."
- "When would you use..."

## Metacognitive Monitoring

### Confidence Ratings
Before retrieval:
- "How well do you know this?"
- Rate 1-5 confidence
- Predict performance

After retrieval:
- "How did you do?"
- Compare to prediction
- Identify overconfidence

### Judgment of Learning
- "Will you remember this tomorrow?"
- "What's likely to be forgotten?"
- "What needs more practice?"
- Guides study decisions

## Common Challenges

### Retrieval Failure
- Don't give up immediately
- Try related concepts first
- Use partial retrieval
- Build from what you know

### Interference
- Similar concepts confuse
- Practice discrimination
- Compare and contrast
- Find distinguishing features

### Overconfidence
- Familiarity ≠ knowledge
- Test without cues
- Try teaching others
- Apply to novel situations

## Success Indicators
- Consistent accurate retrieval
- Faster recall speed
- Transfer to new contexts
- Reduced forgetting
- Confident application
- Self-aware of knowledge state
