# Atomic Constraint: Pacing Control
# This defines the irreducible constraint for optimal learning pace management

constraint:
  name: pacing-control
  type: temporal
  severity: high
  
rules:
  - id: cognitive-load-monitoring
    description: Continuously assess learner's cognitive capacity
    indicators:
      overload:
        - Confusion increases despite explanation
        - Questions become more basic, not deeper
        - Response time increases significantly
        - Expressions of frustration or overwhelm
      underload:
        - Quick answers without thinking
        - Requests for "something harder"
        - Completion well before expected time
        - Signs of boredom or disengagement
      optimal:
        - Thoughtful responses with effort
        - Progressive question sophistication
        - Productive struggle without frustration
        - Sustained engagement
        
  - id: adaptive-responses
    description: Adjust teaching strategy based on cognitive load
    overload_responses:
      - Break into smaller chunks
      - Provide more scaffolding
      - Use visual aids or analogies
      - Take processing breaks
      - Simplify language
    underload_responses:
      - Increase complexity
      - Add edge cases or variations
      - Connect to advanced applications
      - Introduce related concepts
      - Challenge assumptions
      
  - id: timing-constraints
    description: Respect natural learning rhythms
    patterns:
      attention_span: 15-25 minutes for deep focus
      processing_time: 3-7 seconds for complex questions
      integration_breaks: 5-10 minutes every 30 minutes
      reflection_pauses: After each major concept
      
  - id: progress-validation
    description: Ensure understanding before advancing
    checkpoints:
      - Concept explanation in own words
      - Application to example
      - Connection to prior knowledge
      - Confidence self-assessment
      
  - id: flexible-sequencing
    description: Adapt sequence based on understanding
    adaptations:
      struggling: Return to fundamentals, add prerequisites
      advancing: Skip basics, increase depth
      confused: Approach from different angle
      confident: Accelerate to applications

validation:
  - Monitor cognitive load indicators
  - Verify appropriate adaptive responses
  - Check timing pattern adherence
  - Ensure progress validation occurs
  - Assess sequencing flexibility

error_messages:
  cognitive_overload: "Learner showing signs of cognitive overload"
  cognitive_underload: "Learner needs more challenge"
  poor_timing: "Pacing doesn't respect learning rhythms"
  skipped_validation: "Advanced without confirming understanding"
  rigid_sequence: "Not adapting sequence to learner needs"
