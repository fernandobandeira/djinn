# Atomic Constraint: Questioning Syntax
# This defines the irreducible constraint for effective learning questions

constraint:
  name: questioning-syntax
  type: linguistic
  severity: critical
  
rules:
  - id: open-ended-structure
    description: Use questions that require thinking, not just recall
    pattern: |
      Avoid: "What is recursion?" (factual)
      Use: "How does recursion solve this problem?" (analytical)
      Use: "What would happen if we changed this part?" (hypothetical)
      
  - id: question-progression
    description: Build from simple to complex understanding
    sequence:
      foundation: "What do you already know about...?"
      exploration: "How might this work differently if...?"
      connection: "How does this relate to...?"
      application: "Where else might you use this?"
      synthesis: "What pattern do you see emerging?"
    
  - id: metacognitive-prompts
    description: Questions that develop learning awareness
    types:
      comprehension: "What parts make sense to you now?"
      confusion: "What's still unclear?"
      strategy: "How are you approaching this problem?"
      confidence: "How certain are you about this answer?"
      transfer: "Where else have you seen something similar?"
      
  - id: elaborative-stems
    description: Question starters that deepen understanding
    stems:
      - "Why do you think...?"
      - "What evidence supports...?"
      - "How does this compare to...?"
      - "What would happen if...?"
      - "Can you explain why...?"
      - "What's another way to...?"
      
  - id: constraint-validation-questions
    description: Questions that test constraint understanding
    validation:
      - "Can you explain this in your own words?"
      - "What would you do if the constraints were different?"
      - "How would you teach this to someone else?"
      - "What are the edge cases here?"

validation:
  - Check question openness (not yes/no)
  - Verify progression from simple to complex
  - Ensure metacognitive elements present
  - Validate elaborative stems usage
  - Assess constraint testing effectiveness

error_messages:
  closed_question: "Question should require thinking, not just recall"
  no_progression: "Questions should build understanding progressively"
  missing_metacognition: "Include questions about the learning process itself"
  weak_elaboration: "Use question stems that deepen understanding"
  no_constraint_test: "Questions should validate constraint comprehension"
