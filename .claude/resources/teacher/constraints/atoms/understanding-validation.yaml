# Atomic Constraint: Understanding Validation
# This defines the irreducible constraint for verifying learning constraint satisfaction

constraint:
  name: understanding-validation
  type: assessment
  severity: critical
  
rules:
  - id: feynman-test
    description: Learner can explain simply without jargon
    criteria:
      - Uses own words, not memorized definitions
      - Explains to beginner level successfully
      - Identifies and fills knowledge gaps
      - Uses analogies and examples spontaneously
      
  - id: transfer-validation
    description: Can apply learning to new contexts
    tests:
      - Different problem with same principles
      - Changed parameters or constraints
      - Novel scenario requiring adaptation
      - Cross-domain application
      
  - id: pattern-recognition
    description: Identifies underlying structures and connections
    indicators:
      - Connects to previously learned concepts
      - Recognizes similar patterns in different contexts
      - Predicts outcomes based on patterns
      - Generalizes beyond specific examples
      
  - id: constraint-boundary-testing
    description: Understanding of limits and edge cases
    validation:
      - "When would this approach fail?"
      - "What assumptions are we making?"
      - "What are the boundaries of this concept?"
      - "How would you modify this for different constraints?"
      
  - id: metacognitive-awareness
    description: Learner aware of their understanding state
    checks:
      confidence: "How confident are you in this explanation?"
      gaps: "What parts are you still unsure about?"
      strategies: "How did you figure this out?"
      transfer: "Where else might this apply?"

validation:
  - Test explanation clarity and accuracy
  - Verify transfer to new contexts
  - Check pattern recognition ability
  - Assess boundary understanding
  - Validate metacognitive awareness

error_messages:
  surface_understanding: "Explanation suggests memorization, not comprehension"
  no_transfer: "Cannot apply learning to new contexts"
  missing_patterns: "Doesn't recognize underlying structures"
  unclear_boundaries: "Uncertain about concept limits and edge cases"
  low_metacognition: "Limited awareness of own understanding state"
