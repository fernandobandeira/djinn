# Learning Constraint Analyzer
# Diagnostic tool for analyzing constraint satisfaction in learning contexts

## Purpose
This diagnostic analyzes the balance and effectiveness of learning constraints, identifying when constraint patterns are under-constrained, over-constrained, or optimally constrained for learning outcomes.

### Constraint Type Analysis

#### Dialogue Pattern Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Natural flow between teacher and learner
- Appropriate questioning levels
- Responsive to learner needs
- Balances guidance with discovery

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Are questions appropriately challenging?
- Does dialogue flow naturally?
- Is learner engaged and responsive?
- Are there appropriate wait times?

#### Understanding Validation Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Multiple validation methods used
- Appropriate depth of checking
- Confidence calibrated to competence
- Transfer validated appropriately

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Are validation methods revealing true understanding?
- Is validation frequency appropriate?
- Does learner's confidence match competence?
- Is transfer being tested adequately?

#### Pacing Control Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Optimal cognitive load maintained
- Responsive to learner fatigue/energy
- Natural rhythm with processing time
- Progress balanced with consolidation

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Is cognitive load appropriate for learner?
- Are there adequate processing pauses?
- Is pacing responsive to learner state?
- Is progress sustainable?

### Methodology Constraint Analysis

#### Feynman Technique Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Explanation clarity without oversimplification
- Appropriate level for intended audience
- Gaps identified without overwhelming
- Refinement process balanced

**Over-Constrained**: Too rigid about explanation format
**Under-Constrained**: Accepts superficial explanations

#### Socratic Dialogue Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Questions guide without leading
- Appropriate challenge level maintained
- Discovery balanced with support
- Follow-up questions build understanding

**Over-Constrained**: Questions too limiting or leading
**Under-Constrained**: Questions too open or unfocused

#### Problem-Based Learning Constraints
**Well-Constrained**:
- Problems appropriately challenging
- Scaffolding available when needed
- Real-world relevance maintained
- Multiple solution approaches valued

**Over-Constrained**: Problems too structured or guided
**Under-Constrained**: Problems too open or disconnected

## Diagnostic Protocol

### Step 1: Evidence Collection
```markdown
Collect evidence across multiple dimensions:
- Learner explanations and reasoning
- Application attempts and success rates
- Questions asked and understanding demonstrated
- Confidence expressions and self-assessment
- Transfer attempts and pattern recognition
- Response to different teaching approaches
```

### Step 2: Constraint Pattern Analysis
```markdown
Analyze patterns in:
- Atomic constraint satisfaction (basic learning elements)
- Molecular protocol effectiveness (methodology application)
- Cellular memory utilization (persistence and recall)
- Organ coordination efficiency (system-level learning)
```

### Step 3: Balance Assessment
```markdown
Evaluate constraint balance:
- Precision vs. Flexibility balance
- Structure vs. Freedom balance
- Support vs. Independence balance
- Challenge vs. Capability balance
```

### Step 4: Intervention Identification
```markdown
Identify needed interventions:
- Which constraints need strengthening
- Which constraints need relaxing
- Which new constraints might help
- Which constraints conflict or interfere
```
