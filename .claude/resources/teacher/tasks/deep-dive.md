# Deep Dive Task

## Purpose
Facilitate deep technical exploration for comprehensive understanding

## Process

### 1. Topic Scoping
- Define boundaries of exploration
- Identify learning goals
- Set time expectations
- Search KB for prior knowledge

### 2. Foundation Building
Start with fundamentals:
- Core concepts and definitions
- Historical context and evolution
- Problem it solves
- Key innovations

### 3. Progressive Depth
Layer understanding:
1. **Surface**: What it is
2. **Mechanism**: How it works
3. **Implementation**: How to build it
4. **Optimization**: How to improve it
5. **Scale**: How it works at scale
6. **Edge Cases**: Where it breaks

### 4. Exploration Techniques

#### The Five Whys
- Why does this exist?
- Why this approach?
- Why these trade-offs?
- Why not alternatives?
- Why does it matter?

#### The What-If Game
- What if we 10x the load?
- What if we remove this constraint?
- What if we had unlimited resources?
- What if we started from scratch?

#### The How Game
- How does it actually work?
- How would you build it?
- How does it fail?
- How do others use it?

### 5. CTO Perspective Layer
Always conclude with:
- Team capability requirements
- Infrastructure implications
- Cost considerations
- Risk assessment
- Migration strategy
- Competitive advantage
