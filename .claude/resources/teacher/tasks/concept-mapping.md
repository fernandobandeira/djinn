# Concept Mapping Task

## Purpose
Create visual representations of knowledge structure and relationships

## Process

### 1. Identify Core Concepts
- List main ideas
- Find key terms
- Note important elements
- Group related items

### 2. Determine Relationships
- How do concepts connect?
- What type of relationship?
- Direction of influence
- Strength of connection

### 3. Build Hierarchy
- Most general at top
- Specific below
- Parallel concepts at same level
- Cross-links between branches

### 4. Add Link Labels
- Describe relationships
- Use active verbs
- Be specific
- Show causality

### 5. Refine and Iterate
- Reorganize for clarity
- Add missing concepts
- Remove redundancy
- Improve connections

## Map Structure Types

### Hierarchical Map
```
    Main Concept
    /     |     \
  Sub1   Sub2   Sub3
  / \     |     / \
```

### Network Map
```
  A <--> B <--> C
  ^      ^      ^
  |      |      |
  v      v      v
  D <--> E <--> F
```

### Flow Map
```
Input -> Process -> Decision -> Output
           ^          |
           |          v
        Feedback   Alternative
```

### Radial Map
```
        Topic
    /   /|\   \
   /   / | \   \
```

## Relationship Types
- "is a" (classification)
- "has a" (composition)
- "causes" (causation)
- "requires" (dependency)
- "leads to" (sequence)
- "is part of" (membership)
- "is similar to" (comparison)

## Creation Guidelines

### Start Simple
- Begin with 5-7 concepts
- Add gradually
- Don't overwhelm
- Build complexity slowly

### Use Visual Cues
- Color code categories
- Vary line thickness
- Use shapes meaningfully
- Add icons if helpful

### Maintain Clarity
- Avoid crossing lines
- Space evenly
- Align elements
- Keep text readable

## Review Questions
- Are all important concepts included?
- Are relationships accurate?
- Is hierarchy logical?
- Are cross-links shown?
- Is it understandable to others?
