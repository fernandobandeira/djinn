## Agile Integration Patterns

### Scrum + OKR Alignment
```yaml
sprint_planning:
  okr_connection: Each sprint goal connects to quarterly KRs
  measurement: Sprint metrics roll up to KR progress
  adjustment: Sprint retrospectives inform OKR adjustments
  alignment: Sprint reviews include OKR progress updates

backlog_prioritization:
  okr_weight: Stories contributing to KRs get higher priority
  constraint_mapping: Consider cognitive load in prioritization
  value_alignment: Business value tied to OKR achievement
  capacity_planning: Agent constraints inform sprint capacity
```

### Kanban + OKR Flow
```yaml
wip_limits:
  okr_based: Adjust WIP limits based on KR urgency
  constraint_aware: Respect agent cognitive load limits
  value_flow: Optimize for OKR progress over local efficiency
  measurement: Track cycle time impact on KR achievement

flow_metrics:
  lead_time: Request to OKR contribution delivery
  cycle_time: Active work on OKR-contributing items
  throughput: OKR progress items completed per period
  flow_efficiency: Value-add time for OKR advancement
```

### Scrumban Methodology
```yaml
hybrid_approach:
  sprint_structure: 2-week sprints for planning rhythm
  continuous_flow: Kanban for ongoing OKR work
  constraint_optimization: Balance planning with flexibility
  measurement_cadence: Weekly OKR progress reviews

implementation:
  planning: Sprint planning focuses on OKR contribution
  execution: Continuous flow within constraint boundaries
  review: Sprint reviews measure OKR progress
  retrospective: Adjust both process and OKR approach
```

## Purpose-Driven Planning Process

### OKR Setting Methodology
```yaml
cascade_model:
  company_okrs: Top-level business objectives
  department_okrs: Aligned departmental goals
  team_okrs: Agent team specific objectives
  individual_okrs: Personal contribution goals

alignment_verification:
  vertical: Each level supports the level above
  horizontal: Cross-functional OKR dependencies
  constraint_respect: Cognitive load considerations
  measurability: Clear, trackable key results
```

### Quarterly Planning Cycle
```yaml
month_1:
  - OKR setting and alignment
  - Agent capacity assessment
  - Constraint boundary definition
  - Sprint planning with OKR focus

month_2:
  - Mid-quarter review and adjustment
  - Cross-agent dependency coordination
  - Constraint rebalancing if needed
  - Process optimization

month_3:
  - Final quarter push
  - OKR achievement assessment
  - Learning capture and documentation
  - Next quarter preparation
```
